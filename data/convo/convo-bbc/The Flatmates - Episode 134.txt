Episode 134: Tim's management style


Tim:
Oh, that was a long day Sally. Sorry you had to babysit me the whole time. I just thought it was important to get my feet wet right from the start. 


Sally:

Tim:

Sally:

Tim:

Sally:
Well, that's a novel way to run an empire! I don't know that all the staff will like it though.

Tim:
We'll just have to wait and see. Now how about a cuppa just for us two?
