Episode 3:
At the pub 


Tim:
It's your round Alice


Alice:
What, again? Alright, what do you all want?


Helen:
An orange juice please. 


Michal:
The same for me too.


Tim:
	Oh come on Michal, you're not in Poland now. Why not try a traditional pint of English bitter?


Michal:
OK then.

Tim:And the usual for me - a G & T, love
Alice:Em, OK.
Helen:Don't call Alice "love".


Tim:
Why not, isn't she lovely? Michal, what do you think?
