Episode 4 :
Another round


Michal:She's beautiful.


Alice:What's wrong with you?


Helen: Nothing! You know I think Michal really likes you.


Alice: Don't be daft! He's only being polite.


Helen: Do you think so?


Alice: Yes, and why are you so interested all of a sudden?

Helen:
No, no reason really. Look, I've got to get back to the flat, I've got loads of studying to do.

Alice:Oh relax! The books can wait. Tim's buying the next round. What do you want?
