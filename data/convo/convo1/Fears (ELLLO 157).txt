Nanju: Yeah, it's a lot of cobras. I have seen a lot of cobras, and fighting with cobras, each other, but run away so I can not.
Todd: So, you're not afraid of cobras? 
Nanju: No
Todd: Like have you ever seen a cobra by your house?
Nanju: Yeah, I have seen a lot of cobras, which is going to be 12 feet.
Todd: Really!
Nanju: Yeah, sure. 
Todd: And your not afraid?
Nanju: No, I will get some sticks and go through about from my home or something.
Todd: So you get a stick and you go and kill it?

Todd: Sin. It's a sin. Oh, wow.
Nanju: So we won't kill that cobra or something.
Todd: Wow, very fascinating. Thank you.
