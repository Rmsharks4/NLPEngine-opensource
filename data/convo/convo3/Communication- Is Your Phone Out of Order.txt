Ruben: 
Is your phone out of order?
Donna: 
What do you mean?
Ruben: 
I tried calling you all night, but I wasn't able to get through.
Donna: 
Oh, I was on the phone all night. Sorry about that. 
Ruben: 
Well, you might wanna add call-waiting to your phone service if you're always on the phone.
Donna: 
I guess so.
