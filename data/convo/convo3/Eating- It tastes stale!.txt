It tastes stale!
The     two people in the dialogue below want to fix pork chops for     dinner, but they later find out that the meat has gone bad....
Wayne:
What are we going to eat for dinner?
Lilia:
I'm going to fix some pork chops.
Wayne:
I'm afraid the meat is rotten.
Lilia:
That's strange!  I just bought it the day before yesterday.
Wayne:
Well, I forgot to put it in the refrigerator.
Lilia:
Good for you!  Now what should we eat?
Wayne:
Why don't we eat out?
Lilia:
Again?  Weren't you just complaining that it's too expensive to eat out?
Wayne:
Not when you're hungry.
