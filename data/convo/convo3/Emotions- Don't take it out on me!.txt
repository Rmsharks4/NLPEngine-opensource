Storyline: 
Vickie's husband had a bad    day.  He flared up at Vickie at the slightest provocation..
Jack, can you do thedishes tonight?  I'm very tired.
Can't we just put them in thedish-washer?  I've had a very bad day, too!  I just want to kick back and relax.
Hey!  Justbecause you had a bad day today doesn't give you permission to take it out on me!
Just leave me alone, OK!
Vickie:
