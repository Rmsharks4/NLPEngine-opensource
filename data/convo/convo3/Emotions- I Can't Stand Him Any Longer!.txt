Storyline: Andy told Jan that he didn't realize that Gary would fly into a rage at his advice....
Jan:
What's going on between you and Gary?  Did you guys have a fight or something?
Andy:
I can't stand him any more!  He has such a short fuse that even a little piece of friendly advice sets him off.
Jan:
So what did you tell him?
Andy:
I told him that if he could be more patient and try not to lose his temper so easily, he would be more popular.
Jan:
No wonder he threw a fit.  His popularity is really a sore spot.
Andy:
Well, I guess I'll just keep my mouth shut.  That'll teach me to give advice!
Jan:
Not unless you want to die!
