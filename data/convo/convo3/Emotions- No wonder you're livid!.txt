Storyline: Mark tells June that    he was ripped off by a garage.  June sympathizes with Mark and suggests that he file    a complaint with the consumer protection agency.
June:
Youlook so angry. What happened? 
Mark:
Nothing.  I'd rather not talk about it.  Just don't ask.
June:
Come on.  I think you need to let off somesteam.  Besides, you shouldn't keep your feelings pent up.  They'll eat youalive.  So, talk to me.
Mark:
Allright.  This morning I took my car to the garage to have them check theair-conditioner. They only gave it a once-over, refilled it with some Freon, and chargedme 300 bucks!
June:
No wonder you're livid.  I'd be mad, too if someoneripped me off like that.
Mark:
Yeah.  AND they were rude.  They said I didn't know anything about cars, which Idon't, but they didn't have to be so blunt!
June:
Sounds like you got a raw deal!  Maybe you shouldfile a complaint with the Consumer Protection Agency.
