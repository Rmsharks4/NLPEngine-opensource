Storyline: John finds his razor burn irritating.  So, he asks James for some advice....
James
:
Oh, what happened to your face, John?  It looks like a heat rash.
John:
It's a razor burn.  I cut myself when I shaved this morning.  The burns and cuts are really irritating.
James
:
I know how you feel.  Maybe you shouldn't have grown a long, long beard.
John:
Well, I thought it would be fun and would make me look more mature and sophisticated.
James
:
Yeah, my Mature man!
John:
Come on!  Any advice?
James
:
Maybe you could shave in the shower.  The steam really helps soften your beard and moustache.
John:
Hm, sounds like a good idea.
James
:
And you should avoid pressing too hard or tugging on your skin while shaving.
John:
I guess I've been stretching it too often when I shave.
James
:
Hm.  I would also suggest you try this cream I have.  Use it on the affected area.  It really helps moisturize your skin and lessen irritations.
