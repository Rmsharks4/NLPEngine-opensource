    Storyline:   Sydney went swimming the other day. Because she didn't put on the sunscreen, she was burnt to a crisp.
Henk:
Why are you wearing your bathing suit around the house?
Sydney:
Yesterday I went swimming at your friend's house, and I forgot to put my suncreen on.
Henk:
That wasn't very brilliant.
Sydney:
Well, the sun didn't feel hot when I got in, but I guess I was wrong.  I got burned to a crisp!
Henk:
So why the suit?
Sydney:
I can't stand to wear anything else.
