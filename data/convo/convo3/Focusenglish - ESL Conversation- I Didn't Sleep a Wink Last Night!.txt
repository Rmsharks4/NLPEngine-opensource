Storyline:Steve doesn't seem to have enough sleep.  He's been under great pleasure recently. 
Sydney:
Steve, you look pale.  What happened?
Steve:
I didn't sleep a wink last night.
Sydney:
Did you have something on your mind?  You look so concerned!  Maybe I can help you!
Steve:
Well, I'm under a lot of pressure.  My boss is very pushy.  He assigned me three projects.  Now the deadlines are near, and I still haven't finished all of my projects.
Sydney:
Is there anything I can do to help you?
Steve:
Well, I guess one one can help me but myself!  For the moment, I just need someone to talk to so that I can relieve my stress.
