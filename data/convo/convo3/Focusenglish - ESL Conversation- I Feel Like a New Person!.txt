Have you been working out?

Yeah, as a matter of fact, I've been going to the gym for half a year now!

I can tell.  You look really buff!  And no more beer belly!  Have you been lifting weights?

That and I do an hour of aerobics every other day!  I tell you, it's addicting!  I feel like a new man!

Thanks!
