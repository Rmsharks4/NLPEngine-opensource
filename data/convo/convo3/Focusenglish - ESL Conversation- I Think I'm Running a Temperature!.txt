Storyline:Julie suggests to her husband, Davis, that he should not go to work because he isn't feeling well.  
Davis:
I think I'm running a temperature.  My head is spinning, my mouth feels like cotton, and I have a scratchy throat.
Julie:
Let me see.  Hmm, you'd better stay at home today.   And don't work on the computer!  Staying up late with that thing has obviously played havoc with your health.
Davis:
I can't help it.  I guess I'm addicted to the Internet.
Julie:
If you want to keep yourself in good shape, you'd better quit surfing the Net deep into the night. I don't want you kicking the bucket!
