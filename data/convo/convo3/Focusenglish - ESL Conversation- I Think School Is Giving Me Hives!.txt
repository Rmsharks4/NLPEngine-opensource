    Storyline: Judy is so stressed out that she has hives all over..
Diane:
Hey, Judy.  How's it going?
Terri:
Not too great!  I'm really stressed out.
Diane:
Oh?
Terri:
Yeah, I think school is giving me hives.  See?
Diane:
Oh, my gosh!  Your arm is full of bumps!
Terri:
And that's not the worst of it.  You should see the bumps on my legs.
Diane:
What did the doctor say?
Terri:
He said to relax and take a break, but we both know I don't have any time for relaxing.
Diane:
Yeah, but if you don't, it's only going to get worse.
Terri:
I know, I know.... Maybe I can relax after this paper.
Diane:
I sure hope so.
