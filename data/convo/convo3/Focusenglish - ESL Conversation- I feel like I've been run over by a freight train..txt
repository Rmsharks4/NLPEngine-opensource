    Storyline: Sam feels that his cold is getting worse and the cough has gotten deeper. So he goes to see a doctor. The doctor prescribes some medicine to loosen up his chest and calm his cough.
Doctor:
Hi, how are you feeling?
Sam:
Horrible!  I got a cold five days ago, and now it seems it's getting worse.  The cough has gotten deeper, and I feel like I've been run over by a freight train.
Doctor:
Well, let me take a listen to your chest.  Deep breath in...and exhale...Inhale...exhale.
Sam:
Hear anything interesting down there?
Doctor:
It sounds like you have some congestion in your lungs.  Have you been coughing stuff up?
Sam:
A little, but not too much!
Doctor:
Well, we need to get that junk loosened up.  Here is a prescription.
Sam:
What's it for?
Doctor:
It'll help loosen your chest up and calm your cough.  I want you to take it every 4 hours for a week, OK?
Sam:
Fine.
Doctor:
And don't forget to drink lots of fluids.
Sam:
You got it.  Thank you!
