    Storyline: Paula had a great time at the beach, but she was burnt to a crisp because she forgot to put sunscreen on.
Martha:
How did Anneke like her first time at the beach?
Paula:
She had a great time.  She really enjoyed making sand castles.
Martha:
When did you come home?
Paula:
I guess we got home about 3:00.  We spent a good 6 hours there.
Martha:
That's a long time!  Did Anneke get burned?
Paula:
No, unlike myself, I slathered her in sunscreen.  She didn't even turn down.
Martha:
But you look like you got burned to a crisp.
Paula:
You got that right!  Next time, I guess I ought to remember to put sunscreen on, too!
