Storyline: Sylvia broke up with Paul, and she couldn't sleep that night....
Jeanette:
Sylvia, your eyes look swollen.  What happened? 
Sylvia:
I broke up with Paul last night and I was all over the bed the whole night.
Jeanette:
Well, it's understandable, but Paul isn't the kind of guy that deserves your heartache.  Come on.  You'll find a nicer guy soon.
Sylvia:
Well
, I was restless because I was thinking how I was so stupid that I almost trusted the rest of my life to him....
Jeanette:
Oh, Sylvia....
