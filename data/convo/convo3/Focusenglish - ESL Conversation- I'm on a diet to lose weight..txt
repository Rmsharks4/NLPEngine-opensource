Storyline: Martha is on a diet to lose weight, but her friend is trying to coax her into eating a bowl of ice-cream. Can Martha stand the temptation? 
Sydney:
Would you like to have some ice-cream?  I've got a variety of flavors for you to choose from.  I've got strawberry, peach, chocolate, chocolate chip, chocolate brownie, coffee, vanilla, rocky road, butter pecan, and praline.
Martha:
Wow!  What choices you have!  I wish I could, but I just can't.  I'm on a diet to lose weight.
Sydney:
Come
        on, it's just a bite.  It doesn't really hurt to have just a bite.
Martha:
I'd
        better not.  Please don't tempt me.  Please!
Sydney:
Gee! 
        You are really strong-willed. 
Martha:
You're darn
        right.  I'm not so easily coaxed into doing something that I think is wrong.
Sydney:
Well, I'd better not tempt
        you.  Otherwise, if I give you a piece of cake, you might ask for a glass of milk.
