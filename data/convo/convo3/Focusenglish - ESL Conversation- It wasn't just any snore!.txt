    Storyline: Jane didn't get a good night's sleep because she was kept awake by John's snoring. As a result, she looks fairly tired. Mary suggests that Jane buy earplugs so that she can sleep better.
Mary:
Jane you look bushed. Didn't you get a good night's sleep?
Jane:
Nope.  John kept me awake all last night.
Mary:
Oh!?
Jane:
I don't know why.  John rarely snores, but last night he really started sawing some logs!  And it wasn't just any snore.  It was more like a herd of elephants running through the room!
Mary:
My grandpa used to do the same thing. Sometimes he would even wake himself up.  He snored so loud!  I always thought it was funny.
Jane:
Well, I'm certainly not laughing about John. I don't think I can take another night like that again.
Mary:
Have you considered buying some earplugs?
Jane:
You bet!  In fact, I'm going to buy some at lunch!
