Storyline:  John is not feeling well since he didn't had enough     sleep last night.. 
Mary:
You looked tired.  Didn't you get enough sleep last night?
John:
No, I had a bunch of my friends over, and we partied until the wee hours.
Mary:
No wonder you look so bad!
John:
I guess I just can't take late nights like I used to.  My head is spinning, and I have a migraine.
Mary:
I think you need to go home and take a rest.
John:
I wish I could, but I don't think I can keep my eyes open long enough to drive home.
Mary:
Don't worry!  I'll give you a ride home.  But next time, watch the partying, OK?
