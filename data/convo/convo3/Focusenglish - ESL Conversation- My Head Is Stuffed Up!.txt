    Storyline: 
Sam catches a cold.  He asks Alice if she has any cold medicine he can take....
Sam:
I feel awful!
Alice:
You don't look so good, either.  What's wrong?
Sam:
My head's stuffed up.  I've got a runny nose, and I'm aching all over.
Alice:
Poor guy!  What are you taking?
Sam:
Nothing so far.  Do you have anything I can take?
Alice:
Let me go look.  In the meantime, drink lots of orange juice....
Sam:
(Moan.) OK, but hurry back!
Doctor:
(Later)
Alice:
I'm back, Sam.  How are you doing?
Sam:
I still feel like death warmed over.
Alice:
Well, I bought you a few things.
Sam:
Great!  Bring them on.
Alice:
Here's some cough syrup and I brought some cold and flue medicine.  It'll help you sleep.
Sam:
Thanks!  I really appreciate it.
