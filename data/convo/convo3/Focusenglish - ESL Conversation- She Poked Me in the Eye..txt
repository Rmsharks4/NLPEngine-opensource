    Storyline: The other day when Sydney played with her daughter,     her daughter accidentally poked her in the eye....
Jon:
What happened to your eye?
Sydney:
Nothing really.  I went to kiss my daughter on her tummy last night, and she reached up to stop me.  When she did that, her fingernails scraped my eye.
Jon:
That sounds painful!
Sydney:
It wasn't too bad at first, but the next morning it really hurt.
Jon:
What did the doctor say?
Sydney:
He said that it should be OK, but there might be a little scarring over my field of vision, so my eyesight may be blurry.
Jon:
I'm sorry to hear that.
Sydney:
Thanks!  Who knew that a poke in the eye would cause so much damage?
