    Storyline: Robert had a cavity filled today. While he felt a     little better today, the cavity really gave him a headache.
Cindy:
 Hi, Robert, what happened to your face? It looks swollen.
Robert:
I had to go get a cavity filled today.
Cindy:
Did it hurt?
Robert:
I don't even wanna talk about it.  It killed me!
Cindy:
How long were you in the chair?
Robert:
It took quite a while. But the worst part was getting numbed.  They had to give me three shot!
Cindy:
Well, I guess you've learned a good lesson, huh!  You have to take good care of your teeth!
Robert:
No kidding!  Not only can't I stand the pain, but man!  Dentists are expensive!  The bill is going to be humungus!
Cindy:
Don't you have a dental insurance?
Robert:
I do, but it still doesn't cover everything.
