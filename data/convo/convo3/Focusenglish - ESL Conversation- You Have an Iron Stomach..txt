    Storyline: Mike doesn't feel well after eating lunch in a     restaurant. He is suspicious tha the food he ate at lunch might     have made him sick.
Jenny:
What's going on?  You don't look so hot!
Mike:
I have a stomachache.  I think I got some bad food at lunch today.
Jenny:
Really?  But we ate at the same place.  How come my stomach is fine?
Mike:
You have an iron stomach!  My stomach, on the other hand, isn't as strong!
Jenny:
So what should we do now?
Mike:
I've got to find a restroom - and quick!  I think I've got the royal runs.
