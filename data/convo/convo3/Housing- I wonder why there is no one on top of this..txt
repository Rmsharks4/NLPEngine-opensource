I wonder why there is no one on top of this.
Storyline:Last time, the water faucet in Henry's apartment was dripping badly.  This time thewater faucet stops dripping.  Thing are just getting even worse this time. 
Grace:
Why is there nowater coming out when you turn on the faucet?
Henry:
Not even a single drop?
Grace:
Well, it's justdrip, drip, drip.  But that's still not water.
Henry:
I don't know.  Since lastnight water pressure has dropped to little more than a drip.
Grace:
Did you callthe apartment manager yet?
Henry:
Yeah.  I called her thismorning and she said she'd send someone over.
Grace:
But how longago was it?
Henry:
That was three hours ago!!! 
Grace:
That'soutrageous!  I just don't understand why they're not on top of this!
