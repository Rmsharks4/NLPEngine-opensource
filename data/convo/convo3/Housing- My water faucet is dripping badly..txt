My water faucet is dripping badly.
Heather's apartment must be very    old.  Soon after she moves in, she finds that the water faucet is dripping badly all    the time. 
Heather:
Gosh! The water faucet is dripping badly again!
Darlean:
You're going tohave a humongous bill!
Heather:
Iknow.  I've got to get it fixed as soon as possible.
Darlean:
Don't you want toget it fixed now?
Heather:
Iwish I could, but I've got to go now.  I have an appointment in twenty minutes.
Darlean:
Well, if you needanything, just let me know.
Heather:
Oh,by the way, can you give me a ride?  My car is still in the shop.
Darlean:
You sure arehaving bad luck these days.
