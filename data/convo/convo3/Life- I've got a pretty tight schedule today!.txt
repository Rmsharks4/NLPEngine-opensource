I've got a pretty tight schedule today!
    Storyline: Cynthia wants to have a talk with Victor sometime     today, but Victor is very busy.  He has a very tight schedule.
Cynthia:
Hi, Victor, do you think it's possible for us to have a talk sometime today?
Victor:
I'd love to, but I've got a pretty tight schedule today.
Cynthia:
Oh, what have you got going on?
Victor:
Well, I've got to finish a report by ten.  Then I have to drive to the airport to pick up a client of mine at eleven.  After that, I'll have a meeting with him over lunch.  I guess I won't have a break until two o'clock.  But then from three until five, I have to attend a senior staff meeting.
Cynthia:
Wow, that's cutting it close.
