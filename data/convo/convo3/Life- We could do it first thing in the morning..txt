We could do it first thing in the morning.

Neal:
Howmany orders do we still need to pack, Gail?  We've been packing all day.
Gail:
We still have to do about tenmore.
Neal:
Well, I'mreally tired from packing all of the stuff all day.  And it's about time to clockout.
Gail:
I know.  (Gail heavesa sigh.)  Maybe we can finish it tomorrow.
Neal:
Whynot!  These orders are not urgent.  We could do it first thing tomorrow morning.
Gail:
All right. Let's call it quits and go home.
