I can't think of it off the top of my head.
Marshall is complaining to    Pam.  He tells Pam that he is trying to get a hold of Jason, but he forgot his home    phone number.  So he called his office, but his secretary would not give him Jason's    phone number-- because it is against the company's policy to release someone's personal    information on the phone to a stranger. 
Marshall:
Do you knowwhat Jason's home phone number is?
Pam:
I can't think of it off the topof my head.  You might want to look it up in the phone book.
Marshall:
I've checked italready, but it seems that his phone number is UNLISTED.
Pam:
Maybe it's under his roommate'sname.
Marshall:
Well, I guessso.
Pam:
Maybe you can call his office andask his secretary.
Marshall:
I've alreadytried.  She won't tell me.  She says it's private.
Pam:
Oh, that's right.  Theyusually don't release private information over the phone.
