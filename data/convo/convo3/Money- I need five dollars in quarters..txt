I have some coins I need to change.
Syd doesn't have any change    for the parking meter, so she goes to a store nearby.  However, the cashier refuses    to give her change.... 
Syd:
Excuse me?
Cashier:
Yes, can I help you?
Syd:
Yes. I need to get some change for the parking meter.  May I have change for a five dollarbill?  I just need five dollars in quarters.
Cashier:
I'm sorry, butwe're not allowed to give change.
Syd:
Oh. That's too bad!  Is there a change machine somewhere around here?
Cashier:
There is one inthe shopping mall across the street.
Syd:
Well, that'stoo far.  I may have a ticket when I come back.  What the heck....I'll buy acandy bar.
