Really? What's that "something"?
Jenny:
Well, he's gentle, patient,successful, and MATURE.  I think He's my Mr. Right!

MATURE is agood word, but don't you think he's a little old for you?  He's almost twice as oldas you are!

Well, age shouldn't be somethingthat comes in the way of a person's marriage.  As long as we love each other, age isnot an issue.
