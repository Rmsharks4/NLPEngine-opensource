Yeah. (Heave asigh)  Ed is indeed a gentleman.  He has wonderful manners and is respectful ofme.  But I'm really bothered by his past!
Jane:
His past!?  Was he an ex-con or something?
Mary:
No, no,no.  That's not what I mean.  He used to have a girlfriend and he loved her verymuch.  He almost married her if it were not for an accident. 
Jane:
Oh, I see.  But why are youso bothered?  That's already a history, isn't it?
Mary:
I know. But I just can't get it off my mind.
