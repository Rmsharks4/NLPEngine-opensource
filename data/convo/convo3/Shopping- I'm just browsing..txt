Greg:
All right.  If you need any help, just let me know.  Myname is Greg.
Karen:
Sure. I'll let you know if I need anything. (A king-size mattress attractsKaren.)  Hm, this mattress is very firm.  Jack will probably like it. 
Greg:
Didyou find something you like?
Karen:
Yes, this mattressis very good.  It's pretty firm.  The mattress I'm now sleeping on is saggy.
Greg:
You'reright.  This is a very good brand.  It doesn't sag easily.  And we offer alife-time warranty, so you don't have to worry about its quality.
Karen:
Does it come witha frame?
Greg:
Unfortunately,it doesn't.  However, we could offer a ten percent discount on that.  And also,if you're really interested, we have a very good financing plan here.  There's nopayment, no interest until next June.
Karen:
That's anattractive plan.  I'll think about it.
Greg:
Well,you've got to hurry.  This mattress sells pretty well and this promotion endstomorrow.
