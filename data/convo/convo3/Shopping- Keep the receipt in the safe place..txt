Keepthe receipt in the safe place.
John is very happy to buy a    small CD player at a pretty good price.  When he checks out at the register, he asks    the cashier about the return policy.... 
Isthere anything else you would like to buy?
No, thankyou.  I guess that's it.  By the way, in case there's a flaw in this CD player,can I return it?
Yes. But you must return it within 30 days.
Is there a chargefor that?  I know other stores have a restocking fee.
Therewill be no charge at all.  However, you must show us the receipt.  (The cashieris handing the receipt over to John for him to sign.)  Could you sign it here,please?
Thank you. 
All right. Keep your receipt.  If something comes up, you can show it to us and we'll give you arefund.
Thanks.  I'll put it in asafe place.
