At night, as Mac is making the    bed, Liz tells him that Connie is going to have plastic surgery.  Mac is surprised    and doesn't seem to like Liz to do the same.  However, Liz, influenced by Connie, has    become increasingly self-conscious about age signs in her face.... 
Liz:
(
In the bedroom.  Mac is making the bedfor sleep
.) Mac,you know what?  Connie's going to get a face lift.
Mac:
Oh?
Liz:
Sheeven said she'd get the rest done, too!
Mac:
The rest?
Liz:
Yeah! Mac, if my breasts were saggy, would you still love me?
Mac:
What?
Liz:
Answermy question, please!
Mac:
What asilly question!  Love has nothing to do with breasts being large or small, or beingfirm or saggy.
Liz:
I'mjust asking.  You don't have to be impatient.
Mac:
AndConnie.  She's crazy!  No one can sustain youth forever.
Liz:
Yeah. That's what I told her.  (Liz goes to the bathroom and locks herself in it.  She looks into the mirrorand starts murmuring to herself.) Oh, I think I'm getting old.  The forehead is wrinkled, the eyes are puffy, the sacksunder the eyes are dark, and the skin is no longer as resilient as it was. Why!  Age has set in!  Maybe I also need a lift.  Maybe, I need a newlife!  Oh, I really miss the good old days.  At that time, my skin really feltso baby smooth!
Mac:
Liz. what're you murmuring about?  It's getting late.  You should've been in bedminutes ago....
