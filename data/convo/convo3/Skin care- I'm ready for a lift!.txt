In her mid-forties, Connie is    becoming more and more concerned about wrinkles in her face.  She wants to have    plastic surgery to wipe out tired feelings.  Her friend, Liz, on the other hand, is    kind of reserved about it.... 
Connie:
Doyou know anyone who's had plastic surgery?
Liz:
You meanlike a breast enlargement?  I don't think that's really necessary.  That's notthe way a woman should stay attractive.
Connie:
Whynot?  Why can't we go back to the way things were?
Liz:
Because! I don't know!  But, Connie, you wouldn't do that, would you?
Connie:
Darnedright I would!
Liz:
Maybemake-up would be enough?
Connie:
Comeon, Liz.  Be open-minded!  Look at my eyes!  They're puffy.  And myeyebags, they're dark and loose and full of lines and circles.  I really hope surgerycan wipe out the tired feelings.
Liz:
But whatwould other people think?
Connie:
I don't care what other people think.  I'm ready for a lift.
