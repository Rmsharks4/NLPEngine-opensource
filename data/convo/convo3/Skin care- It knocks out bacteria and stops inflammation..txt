John has athlete's foot.      His girlfriend Jenny recommends he use a cream to knock out the bacteria on his foot. 
John:
My toes feel very itchy.  It's really irritating.  I don't know what's happening.
Jenny:
Let me take a look.  Ah-huh, I think you have athlete's foot.
John:
What are you talking about?  I'm not an athlete!
Jenny:
Come on, John, stop joking.  You
'
d better take care of it before it gets worse.  Imagine you have pus gushing out and rashes all over your legs....
John:
Stop it, "Dr." Jenny. 
Jenny:
OK, OK.  I guess I've got some cream for it.  It really fixes skin in trouble.  It's really a help for irritations and blemishes. 
John:
Is it this one?
Jenny:
Not really.  That one is for heat burns.
John:
Have you had athlete's foot before?
Jenny:
Yeah. It was a very bad experience.  You know, if you don
'
t keep your feet dry and clean, the fungus will grow and spread out quickly.
John:
So my case isn
'
t that bad, huh? 
Jenny:
You
'
re lucky. Yeah, here it is.  Now apply it to the affected areas.  This cream is very effective in clearing out bacteria and stopping inflammation from developing.
