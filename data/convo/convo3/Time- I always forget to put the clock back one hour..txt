Ialways forget to put my clock back one hour.
Jessica is late everytime it is    daylight savings time because she always forgets to put the clock forward one hour.... 
Ha, Jessica, you're late.
Yeah. Each time we switch to daylight savings time, I always forget to put the clock forward anhour.
Well, then later this year when we switch back to normaltime, don't forget to set the clock back one hour.
I just can't win!  Each time we switch back to normal time, I always forgetto put the clock back an hour, so I always come to work an hour early.
So, just remember.  Spring forward, fall back.
So, that'llmake it even.
