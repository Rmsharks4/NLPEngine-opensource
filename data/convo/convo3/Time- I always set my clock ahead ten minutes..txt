Ialways set my clock ahead ten minutes.
Roselind is very curious about    why Jamie's clocks show different times.... 
Roselind:
Hey, you have so many clocks in your bedroom.
Jamie:
Yeah, Iwant to make sure I can wake up in the morning.
Roselind:
But is there something wrong with your clocks?  Noneof them has the same time.
Jamie:
I do it on purpose.  I set this clock ahead ten minutes, and this one backten minutes, but I always set that one to the right time.
Roselind:
So the alarms ring every ten minutes?
Jamie:
Yeah.
Roselind:
Are your crazy or what?
Jamie:
No, I am aheavy sleeper.  I need thunder to wake me up.
