That's funny.  My watchalways loses ten minutes a day.
Jane:
Nokidding.
I'm serious. Every morning I set my watch by the radio, but it still loses ten minutes.
Jane:
Youknow what you can do?
Throw it away and buy a new one?
Jane:
No, you don'thave to.  You only need to put your watch back ten minutes everyday.
So you put your watch back tenminutes everyday?
Jane:
Yeah, that'swhat I'm doing.
Why bother?  Just buy a newwatch.  It doesn't cost much.  Besides, I just can't put up with this thing anymore.
