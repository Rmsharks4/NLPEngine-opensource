Excuseme, sir, you can't park here.
Raymond:
I'm just waitingfor my friends.  It won't be long.
Officer:
Sir,the curb here is not for parking.
Raymond:
But I didn't seethe sign, Ma'am.
Officer:
There's a signat the corner of the street.  When you turned in here, you should've seen it.
Raymond:
I didn't see it.
Officer:
I'm sorry,sir.  I have to give you a ticket.  You can appeal to the court within 14days.  You will avoid paying the fine if you can prove that you are not at fault.
