Oh,my goodness, the traffic is crawling.
I think there's an accident ahead.
Roselind:
We'renow running late.
I know.  Whydon't we take a different route?
Roselind:
Letme take a look at the map.  Yes, there's an exit three quarters of a mileahead.  We'll exit Market Street, head west, and then get on the PennsylvaniaFreeway.
OK, let's do that even though wemay have to take a longer way.
