Joe ran through the stop sign    and was caught by the police officer.... 
Sir,did I do anything wrong? 
Yes, sir. You ran through the stop sign.  May I see your driver license, please?
Oh,I'm sorry, I didn't see the stop sign at the corner.  I didn't mean it.
That doesn'tjustify your violation.  May I see your license, please?
Oh,sorry sir, I don't have it on me.  Honestly, I forgot it back at the house.  ButI have the insurance policy with me.  Here it is.
Please wait here, sir.  I'llcome back in a moment.
