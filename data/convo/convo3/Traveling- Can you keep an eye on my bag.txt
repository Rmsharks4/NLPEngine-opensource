Canyou keep an eye on my bag?
Tom is waiting in the lobby to    get on the train.  But suddenly nature is calling, and he has to ask his friend who    is sitting right next to him for help.... 
Tom: 
Canyou do me a favor?
Jamie:

Sure.  Whatis it?
Tom: 
Canyou keep an eye on my bag, please? Nature's calling.
Jamie:

Sure.  Willyou be long?
Tom: 
No. I just want to use the bathroom. 
Jamie:

Go ahead. It'll be safe with me.
