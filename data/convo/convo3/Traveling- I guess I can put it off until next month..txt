When areyou gonna take your vacation?
I was planning to take itat the end of this month.  My husband and I haven't had a chance to have a vacationover the past three years.  So we are planning to travel to Europe this time. Why!  Has something come up?
Well,would it be too inconvenient for you to wait until next month?
Hm....not really.  Iguess I can put it off until next month, but I've got to talk about it with myhusband. 
Thank youvery much.  I really appreciate your being so flexible.
