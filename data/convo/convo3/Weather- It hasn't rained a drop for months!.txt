It hasn't rained a drop for                      months.
Sally:
I                      think a drought has set in.  It                      hasn't rained a drop for months.
I think so, too, but didn't                      it rain last month?
Sally:
It
                      did rain last month, but the rainfall                      was only half the monthly average.
Oh.  That bad?! 
Sally:
That's

                      right.  It's really bad.                       I'm really concerned though not                      panicked yet. 
I don't blame you.  The                      pastures have browned out even before                      the summer hasn't arrived.
Sally:
Yeah,
                      and the soil has been baked so hard                      that the plow can't even break the                      soil. 
Looks like it's going to be                      an ongoing thing that would get worse                      each day.
Yeah. 
                      If it doesn't rain, it's going to get                      critical.
