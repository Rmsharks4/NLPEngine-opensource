Oh, my! The whole world is broiling!
In the                                        dialogue below, Gary                                        and Sharon are                                        complaining about                                        how hot the weather                                        is today.... 
Gary:
Oh,                                my!  It's really                                hot!  I've never seen                                such scorching weather in my                                life!

                                like the whole world is                                broiling.
Gary:
Oh,                                look at the                                thermometer!  The                                temperature has hit 98! 
Sharon:
I                                hope it's not gonna break                                into three digits!
Gary:
But                                it's already awfully close! 
Sharon:
Well,



                                I just hope it'll level off.
Gary:
I                                guess we can't do anything                                until after dark then.
Sharon:
I                                guess so.  What else                                can we do?  You can't                                stay in the heat for long!
