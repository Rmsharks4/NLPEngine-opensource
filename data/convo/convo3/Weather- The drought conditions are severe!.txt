The drought conditions are severe!
Anna:
Did you hear                              that?  The drought                              conditions are severe!                               There's a lot of death, dying,                              and suffering out there!
Rose:
I                              heard that, but it's not                              surprising actually, 'cause we                              haven't had as much rain as                              normal this year.
Anna:
Well, if it could                              rain even a drop, things would                              be much better!  And my                              flowers in the garden would                              come back in a heartbeat.
Rose:
I                              guess you might have to quit                              watering your garden.  I                              heard that they are going to                              start rationing water.                               In fact, this morning I                              happened to hear on the radio                              that the reservoir had dipped                              below half its capacity this                              month and the volume of water                              entering the reservoir is the                              smallest in fifty years.
Anna:
Really!  I                              thought that might                              happen.  Great!                               There go my                              vegetables!  
Rose:
I                              guess so.  But think                              about Africa.
