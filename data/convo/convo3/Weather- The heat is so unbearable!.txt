Oh, the heat is unbearable!
Chris:
Oh,
                      the heat is unbearable!  Didn't                      you turn on the air-conditioner?
The heat has blown our                      air-conditioner on the roof!
Chris:
What

                      the...!  So, what are we going to                      do?
We've got to have it fixed as                      soon as possible.  I've called                      someone and they're on the way.
Chris:
Thank
                      God!
