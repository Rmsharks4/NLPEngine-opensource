The water just went off                      without a warning.
Nancy:
What's                      going on?  When you turn on the                      faucet, it's just drip, drip, drip.
Sandra:
Well,                      it's the second day in a row.  I                      guess the pipes are frozen again.
Nancy:
Really? 
Sandra:
Yeah. 

                      Yesterday the water even went off                      without a warning.  I couldn't                      take a shower, nor could I wash the                      dishes.
Nancy:
Well,                      I'm wondering why the manger isn't on                      top of this!
