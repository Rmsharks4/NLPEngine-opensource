You've got to drink a lot of                      fluids.
It's
                                such a hot day that the two                                people in the conversation                                below just want to stay at                                home and spare themselves                                the worst of the heat. 
Winnie:
Oh,
                      man!  Nobody can stand this kind of                   scorching heat. 
Marc:
Tell me about it!  You                      can't even stay in the sun for five                      minutes.
Winnie:
You'll
                      be scorched like a                      shrivelled plant.
Marc:
Or like a shrivelled old man!
Winnie:
I                      like your humor, Marc.  Anyway, I                      guess this afternoon there's nothing                      we can do but stay home.
Marc:
I guess so.  I don't                      want to be taken to the hospital for                      heat exhaustion or                      sunstroke or something. 
Winnie:
You
                      want my advice?  Drink a lot of                      liquids and spare                      yourself the worst of the heat!
Marc:
Yeah, you're right.  Got                      to drink a lot of fluids.  Do we                      have any beer?
Winnie:
Yes! 
                      Do you want Coors Light or                      Corona? 
Marc:
Do you have any Bud or                      Michelobe?
