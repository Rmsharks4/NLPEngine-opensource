I'moverwhelmed with a heavy workload.
    Situation: Derrick complains to his good    friend Terri that he is overwhelmed with a heavy workload.... 
Terri:
Derrick, don't you think you should take a vacation? Even one or two days would be fine.
Derrick:
There's no way.  There's too much work.
Terri:
But you look so exhausted.  You need a break!
Derrick:
I know.  My chances would be better if they would hire more people.
Terri:
They won't hire more people?
Derrick:
No. They always want to keep the cost down.  I am really overwhelmed with a heavyworkload. 
Terri:
Maybe you should talk to the manager.
Derrick:
Yes. I'm going to bring this up in tomorrow's meeting.
