A: Good afternoon, officer.
B: Your driver's license and registration, please.
A: Here you go.
B: Do you know why I pulled you over?
A: I have no idea. All of a sudden I heard your siren.
B: You rolled through that stop sign back there.
A: But I stopped!
B: No, you didn't. You slowed down, but you didn't come to a full stop.
A: Well, nobody else does, so why should I?
B: That's not the attitude of a good driver.
A: But I am a good driver. I've never had a ticket in my life.
B: Well, you've got one now. Here. Have a nice day.
