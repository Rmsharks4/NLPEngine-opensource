A: Mom, I want a puppy.
B: Let me think about it.
A: Why do you have to think about it?
B: Because a puppy costs money.
A: No, it doesn't. Puppies are free.
B: Yes, but a puppy needs shots.
A: Shots for what?
B: So it won't get sick. Just like you get shots.
A: I hate shots.
B: And a puppy eats food. Food costs money.
A: No problem. I'll give him food off my plate.
B: Oh, no you don't. Puppies don't eat vegetables.
