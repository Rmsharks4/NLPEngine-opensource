A: We have a 2 o'clock appointment to see the one on Main Street.

A: It's an upstairs unit.
B: That's good, because I don't want to live under people with loud feet.
A: And it's a corner unit.

A: No pets are allowed.
B: Perfect. We don't have to listen to barking dogs.
A: And there are only six units in the whole building.
