A: I need to fly to New York.
B: When are you going?
A: During the Christmas holidays.
B: You'd better buy your ticket now.
A: You must be kidding.
B: No, I'm not. It's March. Time is running out. Seats are selling out right now.
A: I thought I would wait until October.
B: I'll bet this is the first time you've ever flown during Christmas.
A: You're right.
B: Well, listen to me. You need to buy a ticket now.
A: But maybe prices will be cheaper in October.
B: Cheaper prices won't do you any good if there are no seats.
