A: My girlfriend's mom got mad at me at the dinner table.
B: Why was that?
A: I sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before I tasted it.
B: What's the matter with that?
A: Her mom is a great cook.
B: So, a little salt and pepper never hurt anything.
A: It hurt her feelings.
B: Oh.
A: I apologized to her, but I could tell she was still upset.
B: Maybe you shouldn't eat there again.
A: I'm sure everything will be okay in a day or two.
B: It's your girlfriend's fault. She should have warned you.
