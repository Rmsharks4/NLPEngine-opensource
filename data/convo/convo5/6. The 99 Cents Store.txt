A: Did you go to the 99 Cents store?
B: Yes, I did.
A: What did you buy?

A: Like what?
B: Well, a dozen large eggs were only 99 cents.
A: That's a good deal.
B: And a one-pound tub of soft butter was the same price.
A: Another good deal.
B: But the best deal was five pounds of potatoes for 99 cents.
A: I don't know how that store makes money.
B: Neither do I, but they're doing something right.
