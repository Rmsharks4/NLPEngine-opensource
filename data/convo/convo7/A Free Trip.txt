Donna:  Your business trips have earned you enough frequent flier miles for a free airline ticket.
Bill:  Really?  That's great!
Donna:  Our company lets their employees use the free airline ticket for personal use.
Bill:  Wow!  I didn't know that.
Donna:  You should probably use it during your next vacation.
Bill:  I think I will ask my wife where she wants to go.
Donna:  Good idea!
