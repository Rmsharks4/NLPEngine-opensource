Mike:  I have a very angry customer on the phone.
Manager:  What is the problem?
Mike:  The customer says he wants to return his refrigerator.
Manager:  Why?  What is wrong with it?
Mike:  He says it doesn't work anymore.  
Manager:  Did you tell him we would try to fix it for free?
Mike:  Yes.  He won't listen to me.  
Manager:  What is he demanding?
Mike:  He wants a free replacement right now.  
Manager:  That is not how our policy works.
Mike:  Can you please talk to him?
