Greg:  I can't believe I have to finish Tom's work again.
Ben:  Why do you keep doing it for him?
Greg:  If I don't do it, it'll never get done.
Ben:  He's such a slacker.  He doesn't do anything at all.
Greg:  I don't know why the boss doesn't fire him.
Ben:  I know why.  He's the boss's son.
Greg:  What a loser!
Ben:  Don't let our boss hear you say that.
Greg:  I don't care anymore.
Ben:  Just don't finish his work and see what the boss does.
