Grace:  Did you hear the news?
Gina:  What news?
Grace:  The company is changing the dress code.
Gina:  What's the new dress code?
Grace:  Every Friday is going to be casual day.
Gina:  What does that mean?
Grace:  We can come to work in casual clothes like jeans, but no inappropriate clothes.
Gina:  That's great!  I hate having to wear a suit every day.
Grace:  This is only on Fridays though.
Gina:  That's good enough for me.
