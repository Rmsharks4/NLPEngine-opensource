Janice:  You need a new look.
Diane:  What's wrong with my look?
Janice:  You should cut your hair.  It's old-fashioned.  
Diane:  I like my long hair.
Janice:  Try something new.
Diane:  I'm afraid to.
Janice:  It's just hair.  It will grow back.
Diane:  Maybe I will.  It's hard to maintain this long hair.
Janice:  Let's go to the salon now.
Diane:  Ok.  You talked me into it.
