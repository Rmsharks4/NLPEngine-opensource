Jon:  Hey, can you give me a ride to the airport?
Leon:  When?
Jon:  Tomorrow morning.
Leon:  I'm sorry, but my car is in the shop.
Jon:  How long has it been in the shop?
Leon:  A couple of days.
Jon:  That's interesting.  
Leon:  What's interesting?
Jon:  I saw you washing your car this morning.
Leon:  You did?  I'm sorry I lied.  I just hate morning traffic.
Jon:  You always try to get out of helping me.
