Karen:  You gave a great presentation.
Tony:  Thanks.  I worked really hard on it.
Karen:  I could tell.  It was very detailed with lots of information.
Tony:  I hope the CEO was impressed.
Karen:  I think she was.  I saw her smile a few times.
Tony:  That's good to hear.  It's scary to give a presentation in front of the head of the company.
