Robert:  There goes Todd again.
Daniel:  What is he doing?
Robert:  Brown-nosing the boss.
Daniel:  What do you mean?
Robert:  He treats the boss like a king and does everything he says.
Daniel:  Oh, I see.  Yeah, I've seen him do that.
Robert:  It's ridiculous.
Daniel:  I thought Todd didn't like the boss.
Robert:  He doesn't like him.  He just wants a promotion.
Daniel:  What a brown-noser!
