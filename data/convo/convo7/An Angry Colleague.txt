Adam:  Sharon is really mad at you.
Blake:  Why?
Adam:  You were late for work and she needed a report.
Blake:  I called this morning and left a message with the receptionist.
Adam:  You did?  I don't think the receptionist told Sharon.
Blake:  Are you serious?
Adam:  Yeah.  Sharon is really angry.  She needed that report for her meeting with the president.
Blake:  I asked the receptionist to print my report and give it to Sharon.
Adam:  You had better tell Sharon.
Blake:  I'm going to talk to the receptionist first.
