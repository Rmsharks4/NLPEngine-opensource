Rudy:  What's on the news?
Carly:  Someone just broke out of prison.
Rudy:  Where?
Carly:  A few miles from here.
Rudy:  Don't open the door for anyone.
Carly:  I know.  I'm glad we have a big dog.
Rudy:  If he starts barking, I'm grabbing my gun.
Carly:  Be careful with that thing.
Rudy:  I'm always careful and prepared.
Carly:  I hope the police catch him soon.
