Polly:  During my review, my boss asked me what my goals are.
Tori:  What did you say?
Polly:  I told her I didn't know.
Tori:  That's not a very good answer.
Polly:  I know.  She probably thinks I have no goals for my future.
Tori:  I thought you had plans to go back to school and get a degree.
Polly:  That is my plan.
Tori:  I thought you wanted a degree so you can apply for better paying positions in the company.
Polly:  You're right.
Tori:  Then why didn't you tell her these things?
Polly:  I got nervous and couldn't talk.
