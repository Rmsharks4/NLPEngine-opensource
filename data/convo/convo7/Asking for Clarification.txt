Frank:  What was the boss talking about?
Andrew:  Weren't you listening?
Frank:  Yes.  But, I didn't quite understand what he meant.
Andrew:  He said no one is getting a raise this year.
Frank:  That's ridiculous.
Andrew:  I know.  The managers are all getting bonuses.
Frank:  The company made a profit too.
Andrew:  I don't know what's going on.
Frank:  I'm going to ask for a clear explanation.
Andrew:  Good luck.  You may lose your job.
