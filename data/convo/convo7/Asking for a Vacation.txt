PHIL: "I need a vacation."
KAREN: "What's wrong?"
PHIL: "This job is so stressful, Karen!"
KAREN: "I think you should ask the boss for some time off?"
PHIL: "I can't right now. I have a big presentation on Friday."
KAREN: "Take a break next week after the presentation."
PHIL: "I have another project after this one."
KAREN: "You need to make a change. You're going to get sick."
PHIL: "I know. But I have a lot of responsibilities."
KAREN: "I know you do. But you also have to take care of yourself too."
PHIL: "You're right. I need to talk to the boss and tell him that I need a vacation. Do you think he will understand?"
KAREN: "I think so. He had a heart attack a few years ago. He understands that health is very important."
PHIL: "Ok. I will talk to him today. Thanks for your advice."
KAREN: "You're welcome. Where do you plan to go on vacation?"
PHIL: "A nice, warm beach."
KAREN: "That sounds great!"
