A: "Hi Alice. What are you doing here?"
B: "Hi Linda. I'm here for a check-up. How about you?"
A: "I'm here for a procedure."
B: "What kind of procedure?"
A: "A root canal."
B: "A root canal? That's pretty serious, isn't it?"
A: "Yeah. I didn't take care of a tooth and now it's infected."
B: "Wow! I'm sorry to hear that. Are you in pain?"
A: "A little. I took some medicine this morning."
B: "That should help."
A: "I don't have dental insurance, so it's going to be very expensive."
B: "That's terrible. Why don't you have dental insurance?"
A: "I didn't think it was important."
B: "I think it's important to have dental insurance."
A: "Yeah. And it's important to take care of your teeth."
B: "I agree."
