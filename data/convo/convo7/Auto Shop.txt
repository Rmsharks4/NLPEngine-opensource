DAN: "Hey Jason. Is that a new car?"
JASON: "Hey Dan. No, this is a rental car?"
DAN: "Where is your car?"
JASON: "At the auto shop. I was in an accident yesterday. The car is getting repaired."
DAN: "Are you ok?"
JASON: "Yeah. Luckily, it wasn't a serious accident. There were just some minor damages to the fender and bumper."
DAN: "That's good. When do you get your car back?"
JASON: "It's supposed to be ready this afternoon."
DAN: "That's quick."
JASON: "Yeah, my auto shop is pretty fast. They have a lot of mechanics."
DAN: "Do they do a good job? Are they reasonably priced?"
JASON: "Oh yes. They do a great job. I haven't had any problems yet. They're a little more expensive than other places, but their work and service is excellent."
DAN: "I may have to get their name and number. My car needs some regular maintenance work."
JASON: "They have a website. Sometimes, they offer discounts on certain services."
DAN: "Really? That's good to know."
JASON: "Yeah. I'll e-mail you the website link."
DAN: "Thanks. I'll check it out tonight."
