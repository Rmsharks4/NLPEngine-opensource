KEVIN: "The traffic is really getting bad these days."
JAMES: "I agree. I sat in traffic for two hours last night."
KEVIN: "I've started to leave work late just to beat rush hour traffic."
JAMES: "I wish I could do that. I have to pick up my son before the daycare closes."
KEVIN: "Oh, I see. What time does the daycare close?"
JAMES: "6 o'clock."
KEVIN: "What time do you usually get there?"
JAMES: "Just a few minutes before they close."
KEVIN: "What happens if you're late?"
JAMES: "They will wait with the child, of course. But you have to pay extra."
KEVIN: "Have you ever been late?"
JAMES: "Yeah, a few times. I was late yesterday. I don't want to pay extra. Daycare is already expensive."
KEVIN: "Yeah, I'm sure it is. Do you have other people who can help you?"
JAMES: "No, I just listen to the traffic report and leave earlier if the roads sound bad."
KEVIN: "Is your boss understanding?"
JAMES: "Yeah, she's very understanding. She has children too."
