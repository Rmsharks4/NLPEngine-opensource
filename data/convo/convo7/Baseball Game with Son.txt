SAM: "I'm taking my son to a baseball game."
JASON: "Cool!"
SAM: "We always watch it on TV, but I wanted him to experience the game in person."
JASON: "My son loves going to the games. He loves the hot dogs and cotton candy."
SAM: "Yeah, I think my son will be more interested in those things too."
JASON: "Where are your seats?"
SAM: "My boss gave me his season tickets for this game. We're sitting right behind home plate."
JASON: "Wow! Those are fantastic seats! You have a nice boss."
SAM: "Yes, I do. He has three children. They are all grown up now, but he still takes them to games."
JASON: "It's a great time to bond with your children."
SAM: "That's what I'm hoping for."
JASON: "Are you taking your baseball mitts?"
SAM: "Yeah. My son wants to take it just in case he catches a foul ball."
JASON: "He may. You never know."
SAM: "Also, I want to take our mitts so we can get them signed by one of the players."
JASON: "That would be amazing. He would probably love that."
SAM: "He would be so thrilled."
JASON: "Well, have a great time! I'll try to find you on TV."
