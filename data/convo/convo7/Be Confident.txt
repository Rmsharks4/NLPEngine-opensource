Jason:  I'm having a meeting with a tough negotiator today.
Chris:  Good luck!
Jason:  Do you have any tips for me?
Chris:  Aim high.
Jason:  What do you mean by that?
Chris:  If you expect more from the negotiation, you'll get more.
Jason:  That makes sense.
Chris:  If you have low expectations, the outcome may not be satisfying.
Jason:  That's true.
Chris:  Also, be confident!
