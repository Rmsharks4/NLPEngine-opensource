Ethan:  My client and I are trying to negotiate a new contract.
Aaron:  Be a good listener.  The best way to negotiate is to listen to what the other side says.
Ethan:  You mean just let him talk?
Aaron:  No.  Ask him questions.  You can get a lot of information by asking questions.
Ethan:  That's a good tip.
Aaron:  Many issues can get resolved if we just learn to listen.
