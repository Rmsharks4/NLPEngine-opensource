MARGARET: "Hello?"
PAMELA: "Hi Margaret. This is Pamela."
MARGARET: "Hi Pamela. Where have you been? You haven't been in school for a week."
PAMELA: "I've been really sick. I had the flu."
MARGARET: "Are you feeling better now?"
PAMELA: "Yeah. I feel much better. I am going back to school on Monday."
MARGARET: "That's good! We all missed you."
PAMELA: "Thanks. Did I miss a lot of school work?"
MARGARET: "Yeah. We had homework every night and we have a test next Friday."
PAMELA: "Oh no. That makes me worry."
MARGARET: "Talk to the teacher. She will understand."
PAMELA: "I hope so. She is a very strict."
MARGARET: "Would you like to borrow my notes from class? I can make copies of them and bring them to you."
PAMELA: "That would be great! I can study them this weekend."
MARGARET: "That's a good idea. But don't try to finish everything over the weekend."
PAMELA: "I know. I might get sick again!"
MARGARET: "I'll see you around 4 pm."
PAMELA: "Ok. Thank you!"
