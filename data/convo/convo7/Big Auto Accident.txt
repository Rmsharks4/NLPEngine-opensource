ALICE: "Hi Mary. What's wrong?"
MARY: "Oh hi Alice. I just got back from the hospital."
ALICE: "Is something wrong?"
MARY: "My son was in an auto accident last night."
ALICE: "Oh dear. I'm sorry to hear that. Was he seriously injured?"
MARY: "Yes. He broke both of his legs and his ribs."
ALICE: "That's awful!"
MARY: "I know. He just got his driver's license a month ago."
ALICE: "How scary for him."
MARY: "It wasn't his fault though. He was hit by a drunk driver."
ALICE: "That's terrible!"
MARY: "I'm so angry about it! My son could've been killed by an irresponsible driver."
ALICE: "You're right! Did they catch the other driver? Was he or she injured?"
MARY: "Yeah, he was arrested. He wasn't injured."
ALICE: "Do you think he will go to jail?"
MARY: "I don't know. I'm just worried about my son right now."
ALICE: "Can I help you with anything?"
MARY: "Well, I just came home to get a change of clothes. I'm going to go back to the hospital soon. Would you be able to feed our cats tonight?"
ALICE: "Of course. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with."
MARY: "Thanks Alice."
