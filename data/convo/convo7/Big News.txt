Mike:  Did you watch the news this morning?
Susie:  No.  What happened?
Mike:  There was a chemical explosion at my old office.
Susie:  Did anyone get hurt?
Mike:  I don't know yet. 
Susie:  You're lucky you don't work there anymore.
Mike:  I know.  The building was so old.  
Susie:  Did they evacuate the area?
Mike:  Yeah.  The police and fire department are still there.
Susie:  I should call my friend.  She lives a couple of blocks from there.
