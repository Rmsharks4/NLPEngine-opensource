SUSAN: "Hi Linda. Who are the presents for?"
LINDA: "Hi Susan. My son, Joseph. Today is his birthday."
SUSAN: "How old is Joseph now?"
LINDA: "12 years old."
SUSAN: "He's almost a teenager."
LINDA: "I know. He is growing up so fast."
SUSAN: "Are you doing anything special?"
LINDA: "Yeah, he is having a birthday party with his friends. Then afterwards, we're meeting my parents for dinner. They want to take him out to a nice restaurant."
SUSAN: "What a fun day for him."
LINDA: "I hope so. We wanted to invite his friends over and have a pizza party."
SUSAN: "Then he's going to eat again after the party?"
LINDA: "Yeah, he can eat a lot these days. He's a growing boy."
SUSAN: "Did you make a birthday cake?"
LINDA: "No, I bought one this time. I didn't have time to bake it this year."
SUSAN: "Don't forget the candles."
LINDA: "Oh no. I forgot to buy some and I don't have time to go to the store. The birthday guests are coming soon."
SUSAN: "I have a brand new pack. There are 12 candles in the box. You can have them."
LINDA: "Perfect! Thank you!"
