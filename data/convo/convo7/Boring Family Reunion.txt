SAM: "Mom, do I have to go to the family reunion?"
MOM: "Yes, Sam. Why don't you want to go?"
SAM: "It's boring and I have no one to talk to."
MOM: "You have a lot of cousins."
SAM: "I know, but they are all younger than me."
MOM: "So, you could entertain them."
SAM: "Ok."
MOM: "Your grandparents will be very disappointed if you do not attend."
SAM: "Ok. Where is it going to be?"
MOM: "It is going to be at an Italian restaurant. Italian food is your favorite."
SAM: "I know. How long is it going to be?"
MOM: "Probably a few hours."
SAM: "Can I leave early?"
MOM: "If you can find a ride home, you can leave early."
SAM: "I wish I knew how to drive."
MOM: "You will learn someday. But tonight you are going to the reunion."
