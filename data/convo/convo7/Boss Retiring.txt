JOHN: "Did you hear the news? Carl is retiring."
DAVID: "Why?"
JOHN: "He's sick. He needs to stop working to take care of his health."
DAVID: "That's so sad."
JOHN: "I know! I'm going to miss him."
DAVID: "When is his last day?"
JOHN: "Next Friday."
DAVID: "That soon?"
JOHN: "Yeah. I heard his doctor told him to retire immediately."
DAVID: "Wow! He's been at the company for 20 years."
JOHN: "That's a long time."
DAVID: "Is anyone going to throw him a retirement party?"
JOHN: "I don't know."
DAVID: "If no one is, we should throw him one."
JOHN: "That's a good idea. Let's talk to the other employees and plan it."
DAVID: "Do you know who is taking his place?"
JOHN: "I heard it was going to be Bob."
DAVID: "Bob? Is he qualified for that position?"
JOHN: "I don't know. People are not going to be happy."
DAVID: "I'm not happy."
