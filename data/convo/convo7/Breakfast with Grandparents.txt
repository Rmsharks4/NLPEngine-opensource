MOM: "Lucy, can you help me with breakfast?"
LUCY: "Sure, Mom? Is someone coming over this morning?"
MOM: "Your grandparents are coming."
LUCY: "Oh, how nice. What are we making?"
MOM: "Pancakes, eggs, bacon, and hash browns."
LUCY: "Yummy! That sounds delicious."
MOM: "I hope so. Your grandfather has a big appetite. I hope there's enough food."
LUCY: "Mom, you always make too much food. It looks like a breakfast buffet every time they come over."
MOM: "I want to make sure there is enough food. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day."
LUCY: "Should I make freshly-squeezed orange juice?"
MOM: "That would be great. Do you know where the juicer is?"
LUCY: "Yeah, it's on the top shelf of the pantry."
MOM: "Oh no!"
LUCY: "What's wrong, Mom?"
MOM: "I'm all out of eggs. Tell your Dad to go to the store and buy some eggs. I'll start on the bacon and hash browns."
LUCY: "Dad! Mom needs you to buy some eggs!"
