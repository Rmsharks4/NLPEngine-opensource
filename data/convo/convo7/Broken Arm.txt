HANNAH: "Hi Teresa. Is David home from school?"
TERESA: "Yeah, we just got back from the hospital."
HANNAH: "What happened?"
TERESA: "David fell at school and broke his arm."
HANNAH: "Are you serious? That's terrible!"
TERESA: "Yeah, the school called an ambulance and they took him to the hospital."
HANNAH: "Wow! Is he in a lot of pain?"
TERESA: "Just a little. The doctor gave him some pain medication."
HANNAH: "That's good."
TERESA: "He's so upset though."
HANNAH: "Because of the pain?"
TERESA: "No. His soccer team is playing the championship game this weekend and he's the goalie."
HANNAH: "That must really hurt more than the arm."
TERESA: "I think it does. He's been practicing so much for this game."
HANNAH: "Is he going to go to the game?"
TERESA: "Of course. He has to go and cheer his team on."
HANNAH: "Hopefully, his team will win!"
TERESA: "I hope so. They were undefeated all season."
