Rick:  My clients are very interested in the house.
Todd:  How much do they want to offer?
Rick:  They are willing to offer $10,000 less than the asking price.
Todd:  I will contact my client and see if she will accept the offer.
Rick:  My clients are very nice people with two small kids. 
Todd:  That's good to know.  My client wants a nice young family to buy her house.  She lived there with her husband for 40 years until he passed away.
