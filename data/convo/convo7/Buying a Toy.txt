BILLY: "Mom, can I get a new toy?"
MOM: "No, Billy. We're here to buy your cousin a birthday present."
BILLY: "Please, Mom."
MOM: "No. Can you help me find something for your cousin? What does he like?"
BILLY: "This toy helicopter."
MOM: "I think that's what you like."
BILLY: "He'll like it too."
MOM: "Are you sure?"
BILLY: "Yeah. He and I like the same things."
MOM: "Ok. Let's get him that helicopter."
BILLY: "I can play with it at his house. If I like it, then can I get one, too?"
MOM: "Maybe for your birthday."
BILLY: "Great! My birthday is next month."
MOM: "You are a smart boy, Billy."
BILLY: "Thanks, Mom."
