Sue:  Ashley wants a cell phone.
Ron:  She doesn't need a phone yet.  She's too young.
Sue:  She says all of her friends have one even a nine-year old named Sally.
Ron:  What do you think?
Sue:  I think it would be a good idea in case of an emergency.
Ron:  She's only 10.  If she has an emergency, she would be with one of us.
