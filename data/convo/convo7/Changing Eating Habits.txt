Tim:  I am so hungry.
Dave:  Didn't you eat lunch?
Tim:  Carol has put me on a strict diet.
Dave:  Why?  Are trying to lose weight?
Tim:  No.  She says we need to live healthy at our age.
Dave:  She is right.  
Tim:  I know, but I miss my meat and potatoes.
Dave:  What did you have for lunch?
Tim:  A salad.
Dave:  What else did you have for lunch?
Tim:  That's it!  I had a small salad.  I'm starving.
