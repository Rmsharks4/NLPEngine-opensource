Hue:  I need to change my flight departure.
Nancy:  When do you need to go?
Hue:  I need to leave tomorrow morning.
Nancy:  Can it be a non-direct flight?
Hue:  I would prefer a direct flight.  
Nancy:  There is one direct flight leaving tomorrow morning at 7 AM.  It's $100 more expensive.  
Hue:  I'll take it.  
Nancy:  When will you be returning?
Hue:  Don't change the return flight.
Nancy:  Ok.
