Walt:  I think we should change the vacation policy.
Whitney:  Why?
Walt:  Other companies have paid vacation.  We do not.
Whitney:  We are a small company. We can't afford paid vacations.
Walt:  Paid vacations would make employees work better.
Whitney:  How?
Walt:  Give employees good benefits and they will work harder.
Whitney:  You have a point, but we cannot afford it.
Walt:  This company is never going to grow if we don't take care of our employees.
Whitney:  I agree, but I don't make the rules.
