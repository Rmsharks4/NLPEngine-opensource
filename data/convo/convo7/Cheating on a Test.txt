TOM: "Hey Robert! Did you hear what happened in my History class today?"
ROBERT: "No, what happened, Tom?"
TOM: "Someone got caught cheating on the test."
ROBERT: "Are you serious? Who?"
TOM: "Peter!"
ROBERT: "Peter? Didn't he get caught cheating last month, too?"
TOM: "Yeah!"
ROBERT: "How did he cheat?"
TOM: "He wrote some things on his hand and Mrs. Jones saw it."
ROBERT: "What did Mrs. Jones do?"
TOM: "She sent him to the principal's office. I think they called his parents. I saw them walking into the school office."
ROBERT: "Wow! He's going to be in big trouble."
TOM: "I know! His dad is really strict."
ROBERT: "Do you think they are going to suspend him from school?"
TOM: "I don't know. But if he continues to cheat, Mrs. Jones isn't going to be able to trust him anymore."
ROBERT: "Not only Mrs. Jones, but other teachers too."
