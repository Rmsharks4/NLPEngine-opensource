DAD: "Greg, I think it's time for you to start helping around the house."
GREG: "Ok, Dad."
DAD: "Your mom and I want you to start doing some chores."
GREG: "Will I get an allowance like Susie?"
DAD: "Of course you will. First, let's start with cleaning up the playroom when it gets messy."
GREG: "Ok. What else?"
DAD: "How about setting and clearing the dinner table."
GREG: "These are easy."
DAD: "And, loading and unloading the dishwasher."
GREG: "Ok. Do I have to do all of these things every day?"
DAD: "No. I want you to share these chores with your sister. You can both decide which ones you want to do."
GREG: "That's not fair."
DAD: "Why isn't this fair?"
GREG: "She's going to pick the easiest ones for herself and give me the harder chores to do."
DAD: "No, she won't."
GREG: "You don't know Susie. I think I want a raise in my allowance."
DAD: "We haven't told you how much you're getting yet."
GREG: "If I have to share chores with my sister, I'm going to be doing most of the work."
