ALAN: "Mom, are there any more chores to do around the house?"
MOM: "There are always chores to do. Why?"
ALAN: "I want to make more money. I'm saving up for something."
MOM: "What is it?"
ALAN: "It's a secret."
MOM: "Ok. There are a couple of loads of laundry that need to be done."
ALAN: "Ok! I can do that."
MOM: "They need to be washed, folded, and put away."
ALAN: "Got it!"
MOM: "Let me know if you want more to do after that."
ALAN: "Ok. I need a lot more to do."
MOM: "I'm curious. What are you saving up for?"
ALAN: "Do you promise not to say anything?"
MOM: "I promise."
ALAN: "I want to buy Dad a new watch for his birthday."
MOM: "That's very sweet of you. He would love it!"
ALAN: "I only have a couple of weeks to save until his birthday."
MOM: "You're a good kid, Alan."
