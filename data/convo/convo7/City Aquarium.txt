BILLY: "Mom, I'm home. Guess where we're going for our field trip this year."
MOM: "Oh, hi Billy. Where?"
BILLY: "We're going to the city aquarium."
MOM: "That sounds like a lot of fun. Marine animals are your favorite."
BILLY: "I can't wait to go. I'm so excited!"
MOM: "When is the field trip?"
BILLY: "Next Wednesday. My teacher needs chaperones for the trip. Can you go, Mom?"
MOM: "I think so. Let me check my schedule first."
BILLY: "I hope you can chaperone."
MOM: "Me too. I love going to the aquarium."
BILLY: "We need to pack a lunch. We're going to eat at the aquarium."
MOM: "Ok. I just looked at my calendar. I'm free that day."
BILLY: "That's great, Mom! I'll tell my teacher tomorrow."
MOM: "Ok, now it's time to do your homework."
BILLY: "I'm so excited. I can't concentrate on studying."
MOM: "I understand. But you still need to do your homework."
