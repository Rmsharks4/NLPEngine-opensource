Ashley:  The coffee shop is busy today.
Ron:  They are having a special.  If you order a donut, you get a cup of coffee for free.
Ashley:  Wow!  I love donuts and coffee.
Ron:  Me too.  How do you drink your coffee?
Ashley:  I like to add cream and sugar.
Ron:  I like black coffee.
Ashley:  The line is long.  There are a lot of people here.
Ron:  I hope they don't run out of coffee.
Ashley:  I hope they don't run out of donuts.
Ron:  That would be worse.
