STEPHANIE: "Hi Stacy. This is Stephanie. Guess what I just got."
STACY: "What?"
STEPHANIE: "Two tickets to the concert tonight!"

STACY: "Are you serious?"
STEPHANIE: "Yes! Do you want to go?"
STACY: "Yes! I need to ask my mom, but I'm sure I can go."
STEPHANIE: "Ok. My dad can pick you up. We're going to leave at 4 pm."
STACY: "What time does the concert start?"
STEPHANIE: "7 pm."
STACY: "Why are we leaving so early?"

STACY: "Ok. I'll let my mom know."
STEPHANIE: "I'm so excited!"
