Jane:  We need to turn off the air conditioner.
Tim:  Why?  It's 90 degrees right now.
Jane:  Our electric bill just came.  It's so high.
Tim:  How much higher is it than usual?
Jane:  It is double the normal amount.
Tim:  Wow!  That is high.  Can we afford that?
Jane:  No.  We need to turn off the A/C right away.
Tim:  But, it's been so hot these days.
Jane:  I know.  Let's turn it on when the temperature is higher than 90 degrees.
Tim:  I don't think I will be able to handle that.
