Gina:  Did you hear our competitor stole the restaurant's secret recipe book?
Bell:  When?
Gina:  Last night.  
Bell:  How?
Gina:  One of their employees broke into the kitchen and stole it from the safe.
Bell:  The owner must be very angry.
Gina:  No, she's not.  
Bell:  Why not?
Gina:  She put a fake recipe book in the safe.  No one knows where the real one is.
Bell:  She is a clever woman and a great cook!
