Kevin:  I need you to cover for me.
Nick:  Again?  Where are you?
Kevin:  I'm at home.  I overslept.
Nick:  What do you want me to do?
Kevin:  Can you do the presentation for me?  
Nick:  Are you crazy?  I didn't prepare for the presentation.
Kevin:  You can do it.  You helped me research the stuff.
Nick:  What am I supposed to tell the clients and our boss?
Kevin:  Tell them I'm stuck at the airport.
Nick:  This is the last time I'm covering for you!
