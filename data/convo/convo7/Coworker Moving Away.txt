KAREN: "Hello?"
JANET: "Hi Karen. This is Janet. Did you hear that Joanne is moving to England?"
KAREN: "Yeah, what a great opportunity for her."
JANET: "I'm thinking about throwing her a going-away party. What do you think?"
KAREN: "I think that's wonderful idea. She is such a good co-worker."
JANET: "Would you like to help me plan it?"
KAREN: "Sure. Let's make it a potluck, so everyone can bring a dish to share."
JANET: "That's a great idea. Less stress if I don't have to cook."
KAREN: "Right! How many people do you want to invite?"
JANET: "How about all of the people she works with. How many is that?"
KAREN: "I think there are about 30 people in our department, including us."
JANET: "Should we keep it a secret or let her know?"
KAREN: "She doesn't like people making a big fuss over her, so let's keep it a secret."
JANET: "When should we have the party?"
KAREN: "When is she moving?"
JANET: "Next month, I think."
KAREN: "Then we should do it soon. She'll be busy packing and getting ready for the move."
JANET: "How about next Friday? It's her last day at work too."
KAREN: "Perfect!"
JANET: "I'll send out an email to everyone tonight. Thanks for your help."
