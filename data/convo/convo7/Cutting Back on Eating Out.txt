Nick:  We eat out too much.  We need to save money.
Beth:  Ok.  Let's eat in from now on.
Nick:  I can cook our favorite meals.
Beth:  I can try to cook too.
Nick:  Your cooking isn't very good.
Beth:  That's why we eat out all the time.
Nick:  I will make spaghetti and meatballs tonight.
Beth:  Do you know how to make meatballs?
Nick:  No.  I'll use a recipe.
Beth:  It might be easier to eat out.
