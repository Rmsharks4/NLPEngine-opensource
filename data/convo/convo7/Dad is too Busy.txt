SALLY: "What's wrong, Jane? Why do you look so sad?"
JANE: "Hi Sally. My dad is not in the audience. He's not coming for my first piano recital."
SALLY: "Why?"
JANE: "He has to work late tonight. He is really busy at work."
SALLY: "I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe he will come to the next one."
JANE: "I hope so. I really wanted him to be here today."
SALLY: "Yeah. I understand."
JANE: "He missed my ballet performance last week too."
SALLY: "Oh, he did?"
JANE: "Yeah. He has a lot of projects at work."
SALLY: "What does he do?"
JANE: "He's an architect. He designs buildings and houses."
SALLY: "That's cool! Did he design your house?"
JANE: "Yeah. He's really good at his job. That's why he is so busy."
SALLY: "Hey Jane. Look!"
JANE: "What, Sally?"
SALLY: "Your dad is in the audience and he's waving at you!"
JANE: "He's here!"
