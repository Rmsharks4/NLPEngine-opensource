CAROL: "Hi Jane. Did you buy some new shoes?"
JANE: "Hi Carol. Yeah, I'm taking dancing classes and I need new dancing shoes."
CAROL: "Where are the classes?"
JANE: "At the local community center."
CAROL: "How do you like it?"
JANE: "I'm really enjoying it."
CAROL: "What kind of dance are you learning?"
JANE: "We're learning a few different types of dance. So far, we have learned ballet, modern, and tap."
CAROL: "Which one is your favorite?"
JANE: "I like tap dance. Ballet was pretty hard."
CAROL: "Sounds like a lot of fun."
JANE: "It is. Do you want to join? Our class is not full."
CAROL: "I'm too old to take dance lessons."
JANE: "No, you are not. You should come to one of our classes. The first visit is free."
CAROL: "Really? Free? When are your lessons?"
JANE: "Every Monday evening at 7 pm."
CAROL: "OK. I'll go next Monday. But don't laugh at me. I'm a terrible dancer."
JANE: "Me too. That's why I'm taking lessons."
