Mary:  Did you hear about the big earthquake?
Sally:  No.  
Mary:  It's been all over the news and Internet.
Sally:  I don't follow the news.
Mary:  Then, how do you know what's going on?
Sally:  If it's important, I'll hear people talking about it.
Mary:  Don't you want to know as soon as something happens?
Sally:  The news is too scary.
Mary:  Why is it scary?
Sally:  They only talk about bad things like crime, accidents, and earthquakes.
