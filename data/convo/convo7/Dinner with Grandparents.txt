MOM: "Ethan, get ready. We're going to your grandparents' house for dinner."
ETHAN: "Again? We went there last weekend."
MOM: "That's right. Remember we go every Sunday evening."
ETHAN: "But grandma's food tastes weird."
MOM: "Don't be rude. She loves to cook for us."
ETHAN: "I know. I love them. But she always makes the same dish, chicken pot pie."
MOM: "Your grandfather likes it. It's his favorite, so we're going to eat it too."
ETHAN: "Ok, Mom. Sorry for being rude."
MOM: "Why don't we pick up a dessert on the way to their house?"
ETHAN: "Ok! Can we get ice cream?"
MOM: "Sure. We can make ice cream sundaes after dinner."
ETHAN: "Mom, that's funny."
MOM: "What's funny?"
ETHAN: "Sundaes on Sundays."
MOM: "That is funny. This will be our new tradition."
ETHAN: "Grandpa will love it. He loves ice cream too."
