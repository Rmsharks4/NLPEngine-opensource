Becky:  Well Carl, do you have any more questions?
Carl:  What time do I start work? 
Becky:  Our office opens at 8 AM.  Can you start at 8?
Carl:  I'm a single dad.  I need to take my son to school by 8 AM.  Would I be able to start at 9?
Becky:  9 AM is a little late for our company.  This may be a problem.
Carl:  Please consider my situation.  It's hard to be a single dad and have a career.
Becky:  Carl, I completely understand.  I'm a single parent too.  
Carl:  You are?
Becky:  Yes.  So I will discuss it with the other managers and ask them to let you start at 9 AM.
Carl:  Thank you so much!  I look forward to hearing from you.
