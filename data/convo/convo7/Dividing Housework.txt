Derrick:  We need to have a talk.
Andrew:  Is there a problem?
Derrick:  I feel like I do all of the cleaning.  I clean up your mess too.
Andrew:  I'm sorry.  I promise to keep the apartment clean.
Derrick:  Why don't we divide the housework?
Andrew:  Ok.  How do you want to divide it?
Derrick:  We will clean up our own messes.  Then, we will take turns cleaning the common areas.
Andrew:  What are the common areas?
Derrick:  Places that we use together, like the bathroom, kitchen, and living room.
Andrew:  That sounds fair.
