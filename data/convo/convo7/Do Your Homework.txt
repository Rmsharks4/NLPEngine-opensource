Zach:  I have to negotiate a deal with a client.  
Bill:  How do you think it will go?
Zach:  Not well.  I heard he is very tough.
Bill:  Do you want some advice?
Zach:  Yes!  I'm not good at negotiating.
Bill:  Make sure you do your homework.
Zach:  What do you mean?
Bill:  Collect as much information before negotiation starts, so you know your options.
Zach:  That's great advice.
Bill:  The more info you have, the smarter you will look.
