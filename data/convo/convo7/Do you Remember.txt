Bill:  Do you remember our 10th birthday?
Mark:  Yes!  We got a puppy that year.
Bill:  I miss that puppy.
Mark:  Me too.  He had a great name.
Bill:  Actually, I don't remember his name.
Mark:  How could you forget his name?  His name was Buster.
Bill:  Oh yeah.  It was a sad day when Buster died.
Mark:  I never wanted another dog after that.
Bill:  How old was Buster when he died?
Mark:  You don't remember anything.  He was 14 years old.
