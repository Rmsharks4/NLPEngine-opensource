Tracy:  I am so angry!
Helen:  Why?  What happened?
Tracy:  Someone keeps leaving their dog's poop on my lawn.
Helen:  That is so rude.  What are you going to do?
Tracy:  I am going to video record my yard and find out who the person is.
Helen:  Good idea!  Then, you can bag it up and deliver it to their house.
