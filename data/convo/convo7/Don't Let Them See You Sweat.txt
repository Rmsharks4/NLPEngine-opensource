Tiffany:  I'm worried about this meeting.
Sasha:  Why?
Tiffany:  I'm meeting with a really tough negotiator.
Sasha:  Be confident.  You can do it.  
Tiffany:  I'm just worried because our company really needs this contract.
Sasha:  I know we do, but don't let him know how much we need it.
Tiffany:  I won't.  I'll look tough too.
Sasha:  Don't ever let him see you sweat.  That will make him think you're nervous.
Tiffany:  I am nervous!
Sasha:  He doesn't need to know that!
