Becky:  I have an emergency.  I spilled coffee on my dress and I need it dry cleaned as soon as possible.
Dry cleaner:  When do you need it?
Becky:  Tonight.  
Dry cleaner:  That is very short notice.  We have a lot of customers this week.
Becky:  It is my wedding anniversary and I would really like to wear this dress.
Dry cleaner:  Wow!  That is a big stain.
Becky:  I am desperate.  I will pay extra.
Dry cleaner:  You have been a good customer for many years.  I will do it for no extra charge.
Becky:  Thank you so much!  I will tell all of my friends about this place.
Dry cleaner:  Thank you, too.  It will be ready by 4 PM.
