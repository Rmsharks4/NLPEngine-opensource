Mary:  I ordered a paperback book.  It should come in 3-5 days.
Megan:  If you order an e-book, you can get it instantly.
Mary:  I don't like e-books.  
Megan:  Why?
Mary:  I like holding a real book with pages.
Megan:  E-books have pages.
Mary:  They're not real pages.  Paperback books have pages you can turn.
Megan:  E-books can be read in the dark.  
Mary:  That's a good point.  But, I still like paperback books better.
Megan:  You'll never change.
