JIM: "Honey, are you ok?"
SUE: "Yes, are you ok?"
JIM: "Yeah. I've never felt an earthquake before?"
SUE: "Me too. That was scary. We've experience hurricanes, but never an earthquake."
JIM: "I'm going to look around and see how bad the damage is."
SUE: "Be careful. There could be aftershocks."
JIM: "I know. Don't go outside. The power is down. There could be power lines on the ground."
SUE: "Ok. Where are the dogs?"
JIM: "I found them. They're both under the bed."
SUE: "They must be scared."
JIM: "I wish we could watch the news. I want to know how much damage this earthquake caused."
SUE: "Let me find the radio. We can listen to the news."
JIM: "I think it's in the garage."
SUE: "Do we have any batteries for it?"
JIM: "Yeah. Let me get them."
SUE: "I knew the big one was coming one day, but we weren't prepared."
JIM: "Yeah, that was a big mistake."
SUE: "We better pack an emergency kit for next time."
