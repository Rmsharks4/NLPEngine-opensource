Bill:  I need to make an emergency trip to our headquarters tonight.
Donna:  There are no direct flights tonight.  There are only non-direct flights.
Bill:  How many layovers? 
Donna:  There is one layover in San Francisco for an hour.  
Bill:  That's fine.  Can you book that flight please?
Donna:  Do you need a ride to the airport?
Bill:  No.  I will park my car at the airport.
