Andrew:  I'm so busy.
Manny:  Are you done with the report?
Andrew:  No.  I've been in meetings all day.
Manny:  That's why I haven't seen you.
Andrew:  Yeah.  I have another meeting at 4 PM.
Manny:  Why do you have so many meetings?
Andrew:  The managers are discussing annual employee reviews and raises.
Manny:  Is it that time of the year?
Andrew:  Yeah.  The end of the year is always the busiest.
Manny:  You're right.  It's almost 4 PM.  You'd better go.
