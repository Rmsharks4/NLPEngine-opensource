Mike:  What are you doing after work?
Sue:  I have to take our clients out to dinner.
Mike:  Where are you going to take them?
Sue:  I don't know.  Do you have any suggestions?
Mike:  There's a really good sushi place downtown.
Sue:  The new one on Main Street?
Mike:  Yeah, that's the one.
Sue:  I can't take them there.  
Mike:  Why?
Sue:  Our clients own it.
