Sam:  The whole file has been erased.
Aaron:  How did that happen?
Sam:  I don't know.  Who was the last person working on it?
Aaron:  I was the last one to work on it.
Sam:  What did you do to it?
Aaron:  Nothing.  I saved the file and went home.
Sam:  I knew this would happen.
Aaron:  Are you blaming me for this problem?
Sam:  Yes.  You always screw up the projects.
Aaron:  You are so rude.  That's why no one wants to work with you.
