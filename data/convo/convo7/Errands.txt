Shirley:  Can you do me a favor?
Sasha:  What is it?
Shirley:  Could you take me to the store?
Sasha:  Sure.  Is there something wrong with your car?
Shirley:  Yeah.  It's in the shop for repairs.
Sasha:  Again?  You just got it fixed last month.
Shirley:  I know.  I need a new car.
Sasha:  Do you need a ride anywhere else?
Shirley:  How about the bank?
Sasha:  Ok.  I need to go to the store and the bank too.
