DAD: "What are you doing, Charlie?"
CHARLIE: "My class has to write an essay about where we want to go on our field trip."
DAD: "That sounds like an interesting topic."
CHARLIE: "My class can't decide where we want to go, so our teacher is going to make it a contest."
DAD: "I like that idea. What are the choices?"
CHARLIE: "Half of my class wants to go to the museum. The other half wants to go to the zoo."
DAD: "Where do you want to go?"
CHARLIE: "I want to go to the zoo because I want to see a lion."
DAD: "Didn't you go to the zoo last year?"
CHARLIE: "Yes, but it was so much fun."
DAD: "You may want to try something new this year. The museum is a great place too. You can learn a lot there."
CHARLIE: "I know. But I want to see animals."
DAD: "Ok. It's your choice. The museum is having a display of old airplanes."
CHARLIE: "Airplanes? I really like airplanes too."
DAD: "You have a tough decision."
CHARLIE: "Now I can't decide. I need to really think about it."
