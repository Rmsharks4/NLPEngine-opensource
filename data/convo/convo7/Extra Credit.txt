ALAN: "Hi Greg. What are you working on?"
GREG: "Hi Alan. I'm doing some extra credit to improve my grade in History class."
ALAN: "What grade are you getting right now?"
GREG: "C."
ALAN: "That's not too bad."
GREG: "It's an average grade. I want to get a better grade."
ALAN: "I understand. What is the extra credit homework?"
GREG: "I have to write a ten-page essay on my favorite president."
ALAN: "Wow. 10 pages is long. When is it due?"
GREG: "I have two weeks to finish it."
ALAN: "I think you can do it. Have you chosen a president?"
GREG: "Yeah. I'm going to do it on Abraham Lincoln."
ALAN: "That's a great choice."
GREG: "There's a lot of information here at the library."
ALAN: "You can search online too."
GREG: "Yeah, I've checked out some books and printed some information from websites."
ALAN: "That should be enough information."
GREG: "I have so much to read and write. I hope I have enough time."
ALAN: "Well, I guess it's not supposed to be easy since it's extra credit."
GREG: "Yeah, you're right. I better stop talking and start reading."
