Micky:  Our deadline is Monday.
Ted:  We still have much more work to do.
Micky:  Let's divide the work this weekend.
Ted:  Great idea.  I'll take half of it home.
Micky:  Ok.  I'll take the other half home.
Ted:  We can email each other what we finish and review it together.
Micky:  That should make things go faster.
Ted:  Do you think we'll finish by Monday? 
Micky:  I think if we divide the work, we will finish by Monday.
Ted:  Ok.  Let's get to work.
