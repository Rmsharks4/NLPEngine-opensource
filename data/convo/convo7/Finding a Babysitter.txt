SARAH: "Hello?"
KATHY: "Hi Sarah. This is Kathy. I have a huge favor to ask."
SARAH: "What is it?"
KATHY: "Are you free tonight? I need a babysitter to watch Michael."
SARAH: "I'm so sorry. I'm not available. We have tickets to the play tonight."
KATHY: "We do too. Our regular babysitter is sick and the tickets are non-refundable."
SARAH: "Jenny is home from college this weekend. Would you like me to ask her if she is available?"
KATHY: "That would be wonderful!"
SARAH: "I'll ask her when she gets home. She went to the store. She should be back in a few minutes."
KATHY: "Thank you! We will pay her, of course. I know she is great with kids. I remember her playing with Michael before. He really liked her."
SARAH: "Yeah, she loves children. She is studying to become a teacher."
KATHY: "That's great! She will be a good teacher."
SARAH: "If Michael has homework, she can help him with it."
KATHY: "Great idea! But I'm not sure Michael will like this idea."
SARAH: "That's true. He may not like Jenny after tonight."
