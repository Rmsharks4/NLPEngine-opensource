TIMOTHY: "Dad, what are we doing this weekend?"
DAD: "I have a surprise for you, Timothy."
TIMOTHY: "What is it?"
DAD: "Here. Open it."
TIMOTHY: "I think I know what it is?"
DAD: "Can you tell by the shape?"
TIMOTHY: "Yeah. Is it a fishing pole?"
DAD: "Well, open it up and find out."
TIMOTHY: "It is! I love it. I've never gone fishing before."
DAD: "Your grandfather and I used to go fishing when I was a child. Now, I can take you."
TIMOTHY: "I can't wait!"
DAD: "You also need a life jacket."
TIMOTHY: "Why?"
DAD: "You should always wear a life jacket if you're going in a boat."
TIMOTHY: "Ok, dad."
DAD: "Now let's go to the fishing store and buy some bait."
TIMOTHY: "What's bait?"
DAD: "Things that will attract the fish to the hook."
TIMOTHY: "Like worms?"
DAD: "Exactly!"
TIMOTHY: "This is going to be so much fun!"
