JOHN: "Hey Sam. You're home? Where's your car?"
SAM: "Oh hey John. It's in the auto shop."
JOHN: "Again? What's wrong with it this time?"
SAM: "I'm not sure. It's making a lot of strange noises."
JOHN: "That's weird. It's not even an old car."
SAM: "I know. I've only had it for three years. My mechanic doesn't know what the problem is."
JOHN: "He doesn't know? What is he doing then?"
SAM: "Trying all different things. I'm getting tired of waiting for him to fix it."
JOHN: "You should take it to another mechanic."
SAM: "I should, but I already paid him. He just keeps saying he will fix it."
JOHN: "He doesn't sound very trustworthy."
SAM: "I know. I should've gone somewhere else. But he was so cheap. He was the cheapest I could find."
JOHN: "Maybe too cheap isn't always better."
SAM: "I'm learning that now."
JOHN: "You should demand a refund."
SAM: "I wish I could, but it's a little complicated."
JOHN: "Why is it complicated?"
SAM: "The mechanic is my brother-in-law."
