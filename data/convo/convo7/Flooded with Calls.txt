Lisa:  I can't get any work done.
Rob:  Why?
Lisa:  I've been on the phone all day with angry customers and our Technical Support department.
Rob:  What's going on?
Lisa:  Service is down.  It's not working in many areas right now.
Rob:  Do you need help?
Lisa:  Yeah.  Can you grab some of these calls?
Rob:  Sure.  Who should I speak with?
Lisa:  You pick.
Rob:  I'll take Technical Support.  You can have the angry customers.
