SUE: "Hello?"
LINDA: "Hi Sue. This is Linda. I have a question about the flu shot."
SUE: "What is it?"
LINDA: "Are your kids getting the flu shot this year?"
SUE: "They already did."
LINDA: "They did?"
SUE: "Yeah. We went to the doctor's office last week. They both got them."
LINDA: "What about you?"
SUE: "I got one too. So did Jeff."
LINDA: "Really? Bill won't get one."
SUE: "Why?"
LINDA: "He says he never gets sick."
SUE: "Well, that could be true. But we don't want to risk it this year."
LINDA: "I completely understand that."
SUE: "Both of my kids got really sick last year. I just want to give them extra protection just in case."
LINDA: "Yeah. I think I'm going to make an appointment for all of us."
SUE: "Even Bill?"
LINDA: "No. He won't go. He'll just cancel his appointment."
SUE: "Well, at least the three of you will be protected."
LINDA: "That's true. Ok, I better call the doctor's office now."
