Dan:  Hi, Phil.  This is Dan Connelly.  We met at the company golf tournament last week.
Phil:  Hi Dan.  Yes, I remember you.  How can I help you?
Dan:  I was wondering if you were still interested in looking at my resume.
Phil:  Yes, of course I am.  Please email it to me.  Did I give you my business card?
Dan:  Yes, you did.  I will send it to you today.
Phil:  Great!  I look forward to receiving it.
