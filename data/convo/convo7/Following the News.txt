Samantha:  Do you follow the news?
Nicole:  Not really.  It's boring.
Samantha:  How can you say it's boring?
Nicole:  It's always the same stuff:  violence and politics.
Samantha:  I have to watch, read, or listen to the news every day.
Nicole:  Then you can tell me what's going on since I don't watch, read or listen to the news.
