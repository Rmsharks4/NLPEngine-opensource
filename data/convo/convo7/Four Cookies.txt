Jon:  Dad, can I have another cookie?
Dad:  How many have you had?
Jon:  Four.
Dad:  Four?  That's a lot of cookies.
Jon:  They are so good.
Dad:  I know.  Your mother makes the best cookies.
Jon:  Can I have just one more, please?
Dad:  You might get a tummy ache. 
Jon:  No, I won't.
Dad:  Why don't you wait until after dinner?
