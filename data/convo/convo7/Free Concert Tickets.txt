Justine:  I have two tickets to the concert tonight.
Kurt:  How did you get tickets?  The concert is sold out.
Justine:  My boss and her husband can't go, so she gave them to me.
Kurt:  That's great!  Where are the seats?
Justine:  Third row!
Kurt:  Wow!  Those are awesome seats!
Justine:  I know.  My boss is really sad she can't go.
Kurt:  Why can't she go?
Justine:  She isn't feeling well.
Kurt:  That's too bad.  We should get her a thank you gift.
