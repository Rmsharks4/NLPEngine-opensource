SUSAN: "Why are you so late?"
PETER: "There was big accident on the freeway. The police closed all the lanes. We had to take a detour."
SUSAN: "Was anyone hurt?"
PETER: "I think so. I saw two ambulances and a fire truck driving by."
SUSAN: "That's terrible."
PETER: "I know. I hope no one was seriously injured."
SUSAN: "That's scary. Do you know what caused the accident?"
PETER: "I don't know. I didn't see it happen."
SUSAN: "You should've called me. We were supposed to meet Cathy and Rick for dinner at 6 pm."
PETER: "After seeing the accident, I didn't want to use my phone while driving."
SUSAN: "That was smart."
PETER: "We should just eat at home tonight. I think traffic is going to be bad."
SUSAN: "Oh no!"
PETER: "What's wrong?"
SUSAN: "I just got a text from Cathy. She said she and Rick were in an accident on the freeway! They're at the hospital."
PETER: "Oh my goodness. Let's go to the hospital now."
