BETH: "Hey Jennifer. Are you going to Sally's birthday party tonight?"
JENNIFER: "Is that tonight, Beth?"
BETH: "Yeah. Can you go?"
JENNIFER: "Yeah. I've been so busy with school exams, I completely forgot."
BETH: "The party is at 7 pm."
JENNIFER: "Ok. Thanks for reminding me. I have one more test at 5 pm."
BETH: "Did you buy a gift?"
JENNIFER: "I forgot that too. What should I get her? Do you have any suggestions?"
BETH: "She likes clothes and makeup."
JENNIFER: "What did you buy her?"
BETH: "I got her a red scarf."
JENNIFER: "I don't have time to go shopping."
BETH: "Why don't you just get her a gift card? Then she can buy what she wants."
JENNIFER: "That's a good idea. When is your birthday, so I don't forget?"
BETH: "It was yesterday."
JENNIFER: "I'm sorry! I forgot yours too. I'm a bad friend."
BETH: "No, you're just a busy friend."
