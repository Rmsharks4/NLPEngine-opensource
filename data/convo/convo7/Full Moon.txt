SALLY: "There's a full moon tonight. Isn't it beautiful?"
TOM: "You know what they say about full moons."
SALLY: "No. What do they say?"
TOM: "Weird things happen when there's a full moon."
SALLY: "That's silly. That's an old tale."
TOM: "You don't believe it?"
SALLY: "No, absolutely not."
TOM: "Do you believe in werewolves?"
SALLY: "What are werewolves?"
TOM: "Creatures that are half human, half wolf. They come out when there's a full moon."
SALLY: "Now you are being ridiculous. I'm going to look for the brightest star."
TOM: "Why?"
SALLY: "If you see the brightest star, you can make a wish and it will come true."
TOM: "Now you're being ridiculous."
SALLY: "I'm going to wish that we stop this conversation."
TOM: "What if you see a werewolf tonight."
SALLY: "You've been watching too many horror movies."
