KAREN: "Mom, can we go furniture shopping?"
MOM: "Sure. What do you need to buy?"
KAREN: "Something for my new apartment."
MOM: "How do you like your first apartment? Do you like living alone?"
KAREN: "Yes, it's great. But my apartment is so empty. I need some furniture to make it feel cozy."
MOM: "What do you need?"
KAREN: "I already have a bed and a sofa that you and Dad gave me. I need to buy a dining table and chairs."
MOM: "Where do you sit to eat?"
KAREN: "Right now, I eat on the sofa. But I'd like to invite people over for dinner and be able to dine comfortably."
MOM: "Can you afford to buy a new dining table and chairs?"
KAREN: "I have some money saved, but not a lot."
MOM: "Why don't we try a yard sale? I always see people selling their dining room furniture at yard sales."
KAREN: "That's a great idea! Maybe if the furniture looks really old, I can get a good deal. I can just paint them."
MOM: "Right! We should go today."
KAREN: "Yes! I'm excited to see what I can find."
MOM: "Maybe I'll find something too."
