Martha:  Are you having a garage sale?
Mia:  Yeah.  I need to get rid of some things.
Martha:  What are you selling?
Mia:  Some clothes, small appliances, and the rowing machine.
Martha:  Why are you selling the rowing machine?
Mia:  It was a waste of money.
Martha:  Didn't you use it?
Mia:  I only used it once.  
Martha:  Why didn't you return it to the store?
Mia:  The store wouldn't take it back.  It was too late.
