MIKE: "Hey Ben, have you seen the price of gas lately?"
BEN: "Yeah Mike. It's really high. That's why I've been riding the bus to work."
MIKE: "I wish I could ride the bus, but I would have to take three buses to get to work."
BEN: "Three?"
MIKE: "Yeah. It would take me twice as long to get to work."
BEN: "That's not good. I only have to take one bus and it takes me directly from my home to my office building."
MIKE: "You're lucky!"
BEN: "I know. What about riding your bike to work?"
MIKE: "No, I'm not very good at cycling and it's too far."
BEN: "You can carpool with someone."
MIKE: "That's a good idea. Then we could share the cost of gas and ride in the carpool lane."
BEN: "Do you work with anyone who lives near you?"
MIKE: "Yeah, my boss."
BEN: "Would you want to ride with your boss?"
MIKE: "No, not really. I think I'd rather pay more for gas."
