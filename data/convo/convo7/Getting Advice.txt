Blake:  When is your business trip?
Tom:  Tomorrow.
Blake:  Who are you meeting with tomorrow?
Tom:  One of the managers, Kevin Johnson.  Have you met him?
Blake:  Yes.  He's a nice guy, but he's very disorganized.
Tom:  That's good to know.  Any advice?
Blake:  Be flexible because he changes his mind often.
Tom:  That can be annoying.
Blake:  Yes, it can.  But have a good attitude about it.
Tom:  Why?
Blake:  Because he's the CEO's son.
