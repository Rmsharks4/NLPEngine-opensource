MARK: "Hey Stan. Did you hear what happened to Winston?"
STAN: "No, Mark. What happened?"
MARK: "He got fired this morning."
STAN: "Why?"
MARK: "He got caught stealing money from the company."
STAN: "How did he steal it?"
MARK: "I don't know."
STAN: "Did the boss call the police?"
MARK: "No, not yet."
STAN: "Why not?"
MARK: "He said that if he returns the money, they will not call the police."
STAN: "What if he doesn't return the money."
MARK: "Then he's going to call the police."
STAN: "He better return the money."
MARK: "I know. He is so foolish. Why would he do this?"
STAN: "I always thought there was something strange about him."
MARK: "He's going to have a hard time finding another job after this."
STAN: "I agree. How can anyone trust him after this?"
