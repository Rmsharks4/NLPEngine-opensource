Tim:  I'm getting laid off.
Lou:  What happened?
Tim:  He said the company is restructuring and they don't need my position anymore.
Lou:  Wow!  I can't believe it!
Tim:  I know.  I just bought a house.
Lou:  That is awful!  What are you going to do?
Tim:  They offered me a severance package.
Lou:  Oh no!  Sam wants to see me in his office.
Tim:  Good luck, Lou.
