Nicky:  Jenny wants a new phone.
Chris:  What's wrong with her current phone?
Nicky:  She says it's too old.  All of her friends have smart phones now.
Chris:  Why does she want a smart phone?
Nicky:  She wants to do social media and check emails.
Chris:  She can't do that with her flip phone?
Nicky: I guess not.  
Chris:  Don't you think she's too young for social media and smart phones?
Nicky:  I think times are changing and she needs to keep up with her generation.
Chris:  You're more understanding than I am.
