Customer:  I see that the interest rates are rising.
Banker:  Yes, the rates have gone up.  
Customer:  What does that mean for my loan?
Banker:  Your loan payments will be higher.
Customer:  I can't afford higher payments.
Banker:  I'm sorry.  There's nothing I can do.
Customer:  I will have to wait for the rates to go back down.
Banker:  That's probably a good idea.
Customer:  Will you contact me when the rates are lower?
Banker:  Yes, I will keep your loan application on file.
