David:  I'm thinking about getting a motorcycle.
Sheila:  Are you crazy?  Motorcycles are dangerous.
David:  I'll be careful.
Sheila:  I really wish you would not get one.
David:  Why?  What's the problem?
Sheila:  I would be worried all the time.
David:  Ok.  I won't get one.  I'll find something else to do.
