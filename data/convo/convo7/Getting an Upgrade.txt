Kyle:  Are you on the phone?
Jessica:  Yeah, but I'm on hold.
Kyle:  Do you have time for lunch?
Jessica:  Not right now.  I'm trying to get a free upgrade on my rental car.
Kyle:  Are you having any luck?
Jessica:  The rental car agent is talking to her supervisor right now.
Kyle:  How are you negotiating?
Jessica:  I told the agent that our company does a lot of business with this rental company.
Kyle:  You're right.  We do.
Jessica:  Kyle, hold on.  The agent is back on the phone.
