Reggie:  My company is filing for bankruptcy.
Lonnie:  Why?
Reggie:  The owner says he's not making enough money to pay all the bills.
Lonnie:  That's too bad.  This company has been around for 30 years.
Reggie:  I know.  It just can't compete with new technology.
Lonnie:  How long have you worked there?
Reggie:  Fifteen years.
Lonnie:  That's a long time.  
Reggie:  I know.  I'm going to miss that place.
Lonnie:  What are you going to do now?
Reggie:  Look for another job.
