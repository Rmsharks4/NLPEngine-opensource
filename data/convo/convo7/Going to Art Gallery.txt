GREG: "I'm going to an art gallery tonight."
CATHY: "That's cool."
GREG: "My friend, Jane, is an artist. She's displaying her work there."
CATHY: "I love art. I paint in my spare time."
GREG: "Really? I didn't know that. My friend is a sculptor."
CATHY: "Sculpting? That's fascinating."
GREG: "Would you like to come with me tonight?"
CATHY: "I can't. I already have plans."
GREG: "She is going to be displaying her work all week. Would you like to go tomorrow night?"
CATHY: "Sure. I would love to."
GREG: "I can introduce you to her. She always loves talking to people about art."
CATHY: "I don't know that much about it. I just really enjoy looking at it."
GREG: "I don't know a lot about art either. I'm just going to support her tonight."
CATHY: "You're a good friend. What is your interest?"
GREG: "I prefer music."
CATHY: "I love music too. But painting is my passion."
GREG: "I would like to see your work one day."
CATHY: "I can show you some right now. I have them on my wall."
GREG: "Let's go see them."
