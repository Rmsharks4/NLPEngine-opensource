SALLY: "Carl. Are you going to watch television all day?"
CARL: "No. Is there something you want to do?"
SALLY: "It's a beautiful day. The sun is shining. We should do something outdoors."
CARL: "Ok. What should we do?"
SALLY: "Let's go to the beach."
CARL: "OK. I'll grab the beach chairs and towels."
SALLY: "Great! I'll pack some snacks and drinks. Don't forget the sunscreen."
CARL: "Where is it?"
SALLY: "It's in the bathroom cabinet."
CARL: "Is there anything else we need to bring?"
SALLY: "I'll bring the camera. I want to take pictures of the sunset."
CARL: "Good idea! The sunset is beautiful at the beach."
SALLY: "Do you remember the last time we went to the beach?"
CARL: "No. It's been a long time. Why don't we go more often?"
SALLY: "Because you're always watching TV."
CARL: "Ok. Let's go to the beach when the weather is nice and watch TV when it rains."
SALLY: "That's a deal!"
