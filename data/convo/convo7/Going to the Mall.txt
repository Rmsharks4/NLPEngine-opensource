JANE: "Hey Carol, are you done with your final exams?"
CAROL: "Yes, Jane! I had my last one this morning. How about you?"
JANE: "Yeah, I got done an hour ago."
CAROL: "Do you want to celebrate?"
JANE: "Sure! What should we do?"
CAROL: "I don't know. Should we throw a party?"
JANE: "What if our friends are not done with exams."
CAROL: "Yeah, you're right. Do you want to go dancing?"
JANE: "I don't know how to dance."
CAROL: "You don't? It's easy. Just move your body to music."
JANE: "I look silly when I dance."
CAROL: "Me too. I don't care."
JANE: "Let's do something else."
CAROL: "Ok. Do you have any ideas?"
JANE: "Do you want to go see a play?"
CAROL: "That sounds boring. I want to do something active."
JANE: "I think we have different ideas of fun."
CAROL: "Yeah. How about shopping? Do you want to go to the mall?"
JANE: "I love shopping. Let's do that. We can eat dinner there too."
CAROL: "Great! Let's meet at the department store at 4 pm."
