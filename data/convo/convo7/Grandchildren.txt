JOAN: "Why do you look so happy, Carol?"
CAROL: "I was just on the phone with my daughter. She is having a baby."
JOAN: "How exciting!"
CAROL: "This will be our first grandchild."
JOAN: "Is the baby a boy or a girl?"
CAROL: "She doesn't know yet. She is only three months pregnant."
JOAN: "Three months? So, the baby is due in June?"
CAROL: "Yes. I'm going to be a grandmother in June. How many grandchildren do you have, Joan?"
JOAN: "I have three. Two grandsons and one granddaughter."
CAROL: "Yes, I remember now. They visit you often."
JOAN: "Yes, they do. I love when they visit."
CAROL: "I'm so excited. I'm going to go shopping to buy my grandchild some clothes."
JOAN: "But the baby hasn't been born yet."
CAROL: "I know. But I love looking at baby clothes. Do you want to go with me?"
JOAN: "Sure. Maybe I'll get something for my grandkids too. Let me grab my purse."
