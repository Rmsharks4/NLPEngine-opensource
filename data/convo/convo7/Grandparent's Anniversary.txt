ANGIE: "Hey Janet, should we do something special for Grandma and Grandpa's anniversary?"
JANET: "Sure. How long have they been married?"
ANGIE: "50 years."
JANET: "50 years! That's a really long time."
ANGIE: "I know. They got married in their early twenties."
JANET: "That's amazing! We should definitely do something special."
ANGIE: "Why don't we throw them a surprise party? We can invite all of our relatives."
JANET: "That's a great idea."
ANGIE: "Let's make a slideshow of their life together."
JANET: "Perfect! That's going to be so beautiful."
ANGIE: "I'm sure Mom has a lot of pictures we can go through."
JANET: "Let's meet at Mom's tonight and plan the whole party."
ANGIE: "Yeah, we'll need her help."
JANET: "We can show pictures of their wedding, their children, and grandchildren."
ANGIE: "Too bad we aren't doing this next year."
JANET: "Why?"
ANGIE: "Then we would have a picture of their great grandchild."
JANET: "What? You're pregnant?"
ANGIE: "Yeah!"
JANET: "There's going to be another big celebration next year!"
