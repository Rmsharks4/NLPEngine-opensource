Stan:  We're 15 minutes early for the meeting.
Frank:  Should we just wait for everyone to arrive?
Stan:  Yeah.  Let's find a seat.  
Frank:  Ok.  So how do you like this weather?
Stan:  I don't like it at all.
Frank:  Me too.  It's been raining all week.
Stan:  It's been raining all week?
Frank:  Yes.  Have you been out of town?
Stan:  Yes.  I just got back from Hawaii last night.
Frank:  I bet you miss the weather there.
Stan:  I do!
