JASON: "I can't wait for summer!"
MARK: "Why?"
JASON: "I'm going to Hawaii with my cousins."
MARK: "That's great! I've never been to Hawaii."
JASON: "It's beautiful there! The beaches are sandy and the weather is nice."
MARK: "My family and I go to Germany every summer. My grandparents live there. They are too old to travel, so we have to go there every year."
JASON: "That must be fun too."
MARK: "It's a lot of fun. But I'd love to visit Hawaii someday. How long are you going to stay there?"
JASON: "Two weeks."
MARK: "What are you going to do after you get back?"
JASON: "I need to find a part-time job."
MARK: "You're going to work the rest of the summer?"
JASON: "Yeah. I need to make some money for college."
MARK: "That's a good idea. I should do that too."
JASON: "How long are you going to be in Germany?"
MARK: "Two months."
JASON: "Wow! That's a long time. That's almost the whole summer vacation."
MARK: "I know. My mom doesn't get to see her parents that often, so we stay for a while."
JASON: "I understand. Family is important."
MARK: "Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could do other fun things during the summer."
