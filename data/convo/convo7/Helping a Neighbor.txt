JANET: "I feel so bad for Mary."
SARAH: "Me too. I can't believe her husband died. They were married for a long time."
JANET: "I know. What is she going to do now?"
SARAH: "I don't know. Does she have any children?"
JANET: "No, I don't think they had any children."
SARAH: "How about other family members?"
JANET: "I think she had one sister, but she passed away several years ago."
SARAH: "So, she's all alone now?"
JANET: "Yeah. Isn't that sad?"
SARAH: "Yes, it is very sad."
JANET: "She is always so nice to everyone. I think we should all get together and do something nice for her."
SARAH: "I like that idea. What should we do?"
JANET: "Let's take turns helping her around the house?"
SARAH: "Great idea! We can take care of her yard, help clean her house, and bring her meals."
JANET: "I love this. Let's talk to the other neighbors soon."
