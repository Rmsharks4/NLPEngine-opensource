Rick:  Are you busy this weekend?
Carl:  What do you want to do?
Rick:  I need help moving stuff to my new apartment.
Carl:  I think I'm busy.
Rick:  You didn't sound busy.
Carl:  I just remembered I need to visit my grandmother.
Rick:  If you're lying, you're a terrible person.
Carl:  Ok.  I am not visiting my grandmother.
Rick:  Why did you lie?
Carl:  I don't want to help you move.
