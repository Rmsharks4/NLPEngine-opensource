Lindsay:  Hi.  I am Lindsay, your neighbor across the street.
Nick:  Can I help you?
Lindsay:  I would like to know why you leave your dog poop on my lawn.
Nick:  How do you know it is me?
Lindsay:  I secretly video recorded my yard.  
Nick:  I am sorry.  I will pick it up next time.
Lindsay:  I brought your dog poop in a bag.   I will leave it here.
Nick:  Ok.  I'm very sorry again.
Lindsay:  Please don't do it anymore.
Nick:  I will never do it again.
