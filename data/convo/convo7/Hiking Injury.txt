KEVIN: "Hey Joe. What happened to your ankle?"
JOE: "Hey Kevin. I broke it while hiking last weekend."
KEVIN: "That's terrible. How?"
JOE: "We were hiking down a steep trail. I lost my balance and fell."
KEVIN: "Ouch!"
JOE: "Yeah, it hurt badly."
KEVIN: "How did you get back to your car?"
JOE: "It was a long, painful walk."
KEVIN: "Were you alone?"
JOE: "No, I was with my wife. But I'm too heavy for her to carry me."
KEVIN: "Why didn't you call someone?"
JOE: "There was no cell phone coverage in that area."
KEVIN: "How long do you have to wear your cast?"
JOE: "Six weeks."
KEVIN: "Six weeks? Are you going to miss the marathon next month?"
JOE: "Yeah! Looks like I am. I'm so disappointed. I've been training for that for a year. Why don't you go in my place?"
KEVIN: "No, thanks. Do you know what I hate more than hiking?"
JOE: "What?"
KEVIN: "Marathons!"
