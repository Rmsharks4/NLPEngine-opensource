Charlie:  We need to hire another person in our department.
Eric:  Why?
Charlie:  We have too much work and not enough people to do it.
Eric:  We can't afford to hire another person right now.
Charlie:  We are all stressed out and working every weekend.
Eric:  I understand, but my boss won't hire another person.
Charlie:  Then I quit.
Eric:  But you're my best employee.
Charlie:  Then ask your boss to hire one more person.
Eric:  Let me help with the projects.
