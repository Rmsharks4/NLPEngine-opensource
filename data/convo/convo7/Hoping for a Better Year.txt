JOE: "Happy New Year, Tom."
TOM: "Oh, Happy New Year, Joe."
JOE: "Can you believe another year has passed?"
TOM: "I'm glad it finally ended. I'm looking forward to a new year."
JOE: "You had some bad luck last year, didn't you?"
TOM: "Yes! I lost my job, my car broke down, and then my cat almost died."
JOE: "I can't believe all of that happened in one year."
TOM: "That's why I'm hoping the New Year will be much better."
JOE: "I'm sure it will be."
TOM: "Yeah. I have a job interview next week. My parents loaned me money to buy a new car. My cat is on medication. The vet thinks he will make a full recovery."
JOE: "That's great! Looks like good luck is coming your way."
TOM: "I hope so. What are you looking forward to in the new year?"
JOE: "Well, Jill and I are expecting our first child."
TOM: "Congratulations! That's great news! The new year is going to be a wonderful one for you and Jill."
JOE: "Thanks, Tom."
TOM: "Hey let's start off the new year with a drink. Do you want to go grab a beer tonight?"
JOE: "Sure! We can toast to a Happy New Year."
