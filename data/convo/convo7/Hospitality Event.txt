Anna:  I'm planning our company's hospitality event.
Joann:  What are you doing this year?
Anna:  We've invited a couple of professional golfers.  We're going to do a celebrity golf tournament.
Joann:  Wow!  That's going to be a lot of fun!
Anna:  I just need to hear back from the golfers.
Joann:  What if no one accepts the invitation?
Anna:  Then I'm in big trouble!
