Helen:  Our company has lost a lot of money.
Mark:  What happened?
Helen:  We are going through the largest recall in the company's history.
Mark:  What is the recall?
Helen:  Airbags.  They can explode without warning.
Mark:  That is extremely dangerous.
Helen:  I know.  We have already been sued multiple times.
Mark:  I don't think the company can survive.
Helen:  I know.  We have a very bad reputation now.
Mark:  I think you should look for another job.
