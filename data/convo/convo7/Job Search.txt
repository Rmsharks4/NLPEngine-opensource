SEAN: "Hey, how's the job search going, Rick?"
RICK: "Not well, Sean. I've sent out over 30 resumes and no one has called me."
SEAN: "I think a lot of people are looking for jobs right now. The economy isn't very good, so companies aren't hiring people."
RICK: "That's what it seems like. But I need a job."
SEAN: "How long have you been out of work?"
RICK: "3 months."
SEAN: "What kind of work do you do?"
RICK: "I'm an electrician."
SEAN: "Have you thought about opening your own business?"
RICK: "Yeah, but that takes money."
SEAN: "I understand. If I hear anyone looking for an electrician, I'll let you know."
RICK: "Thanks. It's been frustrating."
SEAN: "Why did you leave your last job?"
RICK: "I didn't get along with my boss."
SEAN: "Maybe you should've stayed until you found another job."
RICK: "Yeah. That was my mistake. I thought it would be easy to find another job. I was wrong."
SEAN: "Don't worry. You'll find one soon. Come on, let me buy you a cup of coffee."
RICK: "Thanks."
