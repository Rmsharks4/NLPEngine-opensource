Jon:  I'm going to be out of town for a few days.
Devin:  Where are you going?
Jon:  On a business trip to New York.  Can you keep an eye on my house?
Devin:  Sure.  There have been a lot of burglaries these days.
Jon:  I know.  I'm a little nervous to leave.
Devin:  Do you have an alarm system?
Jon:  No.  Do you have one?
Devin:  Yes.  I feel safer with it.
Jon:  Maybe I should get one too.
Devin:  That's a good idea.
