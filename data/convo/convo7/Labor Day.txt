CATHY: "Mom, why do people get Labor Day off?"
MOM: "Well, Cathy. It's the day we honor working Americans."
CATHY: "So, we celebrate people that work?"
MOM: "Yes. Back in the late 1800's, many Americans were working long hours under poor conditions.  People protested to have better working conditions and a special holiday was created for workers. In 1894, Labor Day became a national holiday."
CATHY: "So, people have a day off from work?"
MOM: "Yes. Many businesses close and companies let people take a day off. Post offices and banks are closed."
CATHY: "And, schools are closed, too?"
MOM: "Yes. Schools are not open on this day either."
CATHY: "Is it always in September?"
MOM: "Yes. It's always the first Monday in September."
CATHY: "Do we do anything special on this day?"
MOM: "Well, now it's also celebrated as the end of summer."
CATHY: "Is that why we always have a picnic and get together with family and friends?"
MOM: "Yes. Some places even have fireworks and parades."
CATHY: "I'm glad there is a day to honor hard-working people."
MOM: "Yes, Cathy. One day you will also be a hard-working American."
