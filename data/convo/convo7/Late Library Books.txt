KATE: "Hi Janet. Where are you going with those books?"
JANET: "To the library. I found these under Joseph's bed."
KATE: "Under his bed?"
JANET: "Yeah. They are all overdue."
KATE: "How did you find them?"
JANET: "We got a notice from the library that he had several overdue books, so I started searching his room."
KATE: "How late are they?"
JANET: "About two months."
KATE: "Didn't you receive notices before?"
JANET: "I found the notices in his room too."
KATE: "Why didn't he return them?"
JANET: "He said he couldn't find them."
KATE: "Is he in trouble?"
JANET: "Of course he's in trouble. He doesn't get to play video games for each book that is late."
KATE: "That's five weeks."
JANET: "Yes. That's his punishment. He needs to learn not to hide letters that come in the mail. He also needs to learn to clean his room, so things don't get lost."
