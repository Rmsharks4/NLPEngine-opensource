Steve:  Brian, can you cover for me?
Brian:  Again?  I can't keep covering for you.
Steve:  I'm sorry, but I have to leave early today.
Brian:  What is your excuse this time?  
Steve:  I have tickets to the baseball game.
Brian:  You can't leave early for that.
Steve:  Our seats are right behind home plate.
Brian:  You really shouldn't go tonight.
Steve:  Why?
Brian:  Because our boss has tickets for tonight's game.  They are also behind home plate.
