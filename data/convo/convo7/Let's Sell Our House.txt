Carl:  Let's sell the house.
Wendy:  Why?  I love this house.
Carl:  It's too much work to take care of.
Wendy:  We raised four kids in this house.
Carl:  They're all grown up now.  
Wendy:  There would be no memories in a new house.
Carl:  We would make new memories.
Wendy:  I really don't want to move, Carl.
Carl:  Ok.  I understand.  You talked me out of it.
