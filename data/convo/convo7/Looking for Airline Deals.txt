RUTH: "Hi Carol. Have you seen any airline deals lately?"
CAROL: "Hi Ruth. No, I haven't. Are you planning a trip?"
RUTH: "Yeah. Stan and I want to visit our daughter in London. She moved there last year."
CAROL: "Why?"
RUTH: "Her job was transferred there."
CAROL: "Does she like living there?"
RUTH: "She loves living in England. She wants us to visit, but the airfare is very expensive."
CAROL: "Have you called any travel agencies? Sometimes they have special deals."
RUTH: "I've called travel agencies and looked online, but everything is expensive."
CAROL: "Yeah, airfare is getting more and more expensive every year."
RUTH: "I know. You travel a lot. Where do you buy your airplane tickets?"
CAROL: "My traveling is for work. My company pays for the tickets."
RUTH: "That's nice."
CAROL: "Yeah. One of my business trips was to Hawaii. I got to fly in First Class."
RUTH: "That's amazing! We rarely travel by plane. I'd rather take the train."
CAROL: "Well, you can't take the train across the ocean."
RUTH: "I wish we could."
