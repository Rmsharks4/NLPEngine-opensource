BILL: "Hey Matt, you're home early today."
MATT: "Oh, hi Bill. I got laid off today."
BILL: "I'm sorry to hear that. Why?"
MATT: "The company is downsizing and they eliminated my position."
BILL: "That's terrible. How long did you work there?"
MATT: "15 years."
BILL: "Wow! That's a long time."
MATT: "I know. I worked very hard, but I guess it wasn't enough."
BILL: "Don't say that. Companies usually downsize because they are losing money."
MATT: "I know. I just don't know what to do now. I have a family to take care of."
BILL: "Does your wife know?"
MATT: "Not yet. She's at work. I didn't want to give her bad news there."
BILL: "I understand. What kind of work did you do?"
MATT: "I'm a graphic designer."
BILL: "Really? My son is a website developer. Do you know anything about web design?"
MATT: "That's my specialty."
BILL: "Let me give him a call. Maybe he can help you find a job."
MATT: "That would be great! I really appreciate it."
