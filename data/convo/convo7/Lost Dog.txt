MARK: "What's wrong Phil?"
PHIL: "Hi Mark. Our dog, Rusty, is lost. Someone left the backyard gate open and he got out."
MARK: "Oh no. Let me help you find him."
PHIL: "Thanks. My daughter is so upset right now."
MARK: "Have you called the local dog shelters?"
PHIL: "Yeah, they haven't seen him. They said they would call me if they find our dog."
MARK: "Does he have any identification on him?"
PHIL: "Yeah. He's wearing his dog tag and he's also microchipped."
MARK: "That's good. Should we make some flyers to post around the neighborhood?"
PHIL: "My wife is doing that right now."
MARK: "How old is Rusty?"
PHIL: "He's four years old and he's brown with white spots."
MARK: "I know what he looks like."
PHIL: "Oh, that's right. I'm not thinking straight. I'm just worried he was stolen or is injured somewhere."
MARK: "I understand. He's part of your family."
PHIL: "Yeah, he's a big part of our family. We got him when he was a little puppy."
MARK: "Hey Phil! There he is!"
PHIL: "Rusty! Come here, boy!"
