SUSAN: "Mary, I am so angry!"
MARY: "What happened, Susan?"
SUSAN: "Our hotel lost our reservations?"
MARY: "How did that happen?"
SUSAN: "I don't know. They didn't have a reasonable explanation."
MARY: "Well, can't you just make another reservation?"
SUSAN: "No. They said there are no more rooms available."
MARY: "Oh no! That's terrible."
SUSAN: "We are attending my niece's wedding this weekend and everyone is staying at that hotel."
MARY: "What about another hotel in that area."
SUSAN: "There's going to be a big doctor's conference this weekend. There are no rooms available at any of the nearby hotels."
MARY: "Did the hotel apologize?"
SUSAN: "Yes and they offered us a discount on our next visit."
MARY: "Did you accept it?"
SUSAN: "No. I was so mad. I told them that I would never stay at a place that lost our original reservations."
MARY: "What did they say?"
SUSAN: "They just kept apologizing."
MARY: "What are you going to do?"
SUSAN: "I don't know. My niece is very upset. Our daughter is the photographer."
