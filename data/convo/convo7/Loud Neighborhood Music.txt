JOAN: "Hi Helen. What's wrong?"
HELEN: "I couldn't sleep until 3 o'clock in the morning."
JOAN: "Why? What happened?"
HELEN: "Our neighbors' children threw a big party last night. The music was so loud."
JOAN: "Wow! Where were their parents?"
HELEN: "They are on vacation. They left the kids home."
JOAN: "How old are the kids?"
HELEN: "They're teenagers. They're old enough to be home alone."
JOAN: "Did you complain to them?"
HELEN: "Yes! I went over there three times. I told them that their music was too loud and we were trying to sleep."
JOAN: "What did they do?"
HELEN: "Nothing. They wouldn't turn the music down."
JOAN: "That is so rude! Why didn't you call the police?"
HELEN: "I finally did. The police found some of the teens drinking alcohol."
JOAN: "I bet that ended the party."
HELEN: "Yeah. Now my neighbors are heading back home from their vacation."
JOAN: "Do they know what happened?"
HELEN: "Yes. They are not happy. Those kids are in big trouble."
