A: "Hello. Thank you for calling Dr. Smith's office. How can I help you?"
B: "This is Eleanor Johnson. I'd like to make an appointment to see the dentist."
A: "Will this be your first visit?"
B: "Yes. I haven't been to the dentist in a while. I'm afraid of going to the dentist."
A: "Oh. You will like Dr. Smith. He is very gentle."
B: "That's nice to hear."
A: "Is there anything wrong with your teeth?"
B: "I have a toothache."
A: "We have an opening tomorrow morning at 9 am."
B: "Do you have anything this afternoon. My tooth hurts very much."
A: "We are very busy this afternoon, but I can squeeze you in around 4 pm. Does that work for you?"
B: "Yes! 4 pm is perfect."
A: "Do you have dental insurance?"
B: "Yes, I do."
A: "Ok. Please come 15 minutes early to fill out some forms."
B: "Ok. I will be there at 3:45. Thank you so much."
A: "You're welcome. We'll see you soon."
B: "Bye."
