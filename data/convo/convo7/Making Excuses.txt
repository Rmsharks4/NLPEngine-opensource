Mary:  Sharon, I've been looking for you.
Sharon:  Is there a problem?
Mary:  No.  I need someone to pick up a client from the airport on Saturday.
Sharon:  I thought Greg was doing that.
Mary:  He says he has to visit his parents this weekend.
Sharon:  He didn't mention that to me.
Mary:  Are you busy this Saturday?
Sharon:  I'm sorry.  I just got an urgent email.  I need to reply immediately.
Mary:  I see.  I will talk to you later then.
Sharon:  I'll be busy meeting clients all day.
