JEFF: "Hello?"
CARL: "Hi Jeff. This is Carl. Have you finished the math assignment?"
JEFF: "No, not yet. I'm still working on it."
CARL: "It's really difficult. Are you having a hard time with it?"
JEFF: "I am. I've been stuck on a problem for an hour."
CARL: "Is it number 4?"
JEFF: "Yes! I cannot figure it out! Have you?"
CARL: "No. That's why I'm calling."
JEFF: "Do you want to work on it together?"
CARL: "I can't come over. I'm babysitting my younger brother."
JEFF: "Do you want me to go there?"
CARL: "No, my parents said I cannot have any friends over when I'm babysitting."
JEFF: "I see. Do you want to discuss it over the phone?"
CARL: "Ok. What have you done so far?"
JEFF: "Nothing. I didn't know where to begin."
CARL: "Me too. I wrote some things, and then I erased it. It didn't make any sense."
JEFF: "What are we going to do?"
CARL: "Can you ask your parents?"
JEFF: "No. They're not home either."
CARL: "Let's call Lucy. She's really good in math. She'll have the answer."
