BARBARA: "Hi Susan. How do you think you did on the math test today?"
SUSAN: "Hi Barbara. I think I did well. It was pretty easy."
BARBARA: "Really? It was very hard for me. I'm having a hard time in this class."
SUSAN: "I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you should get a tutor."
BARBARA: "A tutor?"
SUSAN: "Yeah, I had a tutor last year and she helped me a lot."
BARBARA: "That sounds like a great idea. Could I have your tutor's phone number?"
SUSAN: "Unfortunately, she doesn't live in this state anymore. She moved away for college."
BARBARA: "Ok. That's too bad. I don't know where to look."
SUSAN: "I can ask my mom. She knows a couple of local college students."
BARBARA: "Thanks. That would be great."
SUSAN: "Until then, I can try to help you too. I like math. It's my favorite subject."
BARBARA: "Really? That would be awesome."
SUSAN: "Do you want to work on our homework together?"
BARBARA: "Sure! I would love to."
SUSAN: "Ok. Let's meet after school in front of the cafeteria."
