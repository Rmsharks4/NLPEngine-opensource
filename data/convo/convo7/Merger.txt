Nathan:  Did you hear about the merger?
Charlie:  Yeah.  
Nathan:  I'm excited. 
Charlie:  Why?  Aren't you worried?
Nathan:  No.  We're merging with a well-known company.  It will look good on our resumes. 
Charlie:  Unless we get laid off during the process.
Nathan:  Why do you have to be so negative?
