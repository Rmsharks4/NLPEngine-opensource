Robert:  I don't think we can be roommates anymore.
Frank:  Why?  Is there something wrong?
Robert:  Yes, you never clean up your mess.  
Frank:  I'm sorry.  I will try to clean up more often.
Robert:  You need to do your share of the housework.
Frank:  Ok.  I promise to clean up my mess, do my dishes, and take turns vacuuming.
