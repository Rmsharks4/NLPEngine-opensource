MARY: "Mom, have you seen my homework?"
MOM: "No, Mary. Where did you last see it?"
MARY: "On my desk. I was working on it and then I decided to take a break."
MOM: "That's strange. Where could it be?"
MARY: "It's due tomorrow. What am I going to do?"
MOM: "Don't worry. We'll find it. Let's look for it together."
MARY: "But I didn't take it off my desk."
MOM: "Are you sure? Where did you go to take a break?"
MARY: "Outside. I took a walk to get some fresh air."
MOM: "Did you do anything else?"
MARY: "I got a snack from the kitchen."
MOM: "You go check outside and I'll check the kitchen."
MARY: "Ok."
MOM: "Mary."
MARY: "Yes, Mom?"
MOM: "What's that on the kitchen counter?"
MARY: "Oh. That's my homework."
MOM: "How did it get there?"
MARY: "I must've taken it to the kitchen when I grabbed a snack."
MOM: "You must be studying too hard. Take another break."
