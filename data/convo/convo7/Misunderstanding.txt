BILL: "Hey Joe. Have you seen Sandy?"
JOE: "No, Bill. Why?"
BILL: "We had a misunderstanding and she is not talking to me."
JOE: "Oh. I'm sorry to hear that."
BILL: "Yeah. I said something silly and hurt her feelings."
JOE: "What did you say?"
BILL: "It's not important. I don't want to discuss it. I just want to apologize to her."
JOE: "She always hangs out at Linda's house or the library."
BILL: "I've already checked both places."
JOE: "How about her house."
BILL: "Her roommate said she wasn't home."
JOE: "Have you called her cell phone."
BILL: "Yeah, several times."
JOE: "She must really be mad at you."
BILL: "She was! She stormed off and I didn't get to explain what I meant."
JOE: "I'm really curious now. What did you say to her?"
BILL: "I told her to exercise."
JOE: "Well, that probably wasn't a smart thing to say to a woman."
BILL: "I meant that she should exercise to stay healthy."
JOE: "That sounds better. Hope you find her."
