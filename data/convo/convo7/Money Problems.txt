Josh:  I need a new job.
Cory:  Why?
Josh:  This job doesn't pay enough.
Cory:  Are you having money problems?
Josh:  Yeah.  I don't have enough money for bills and rent.  
Cory:  But you drive a nice car and wear expensive things.
Josh:  I need those things.
Cory:  I don't think you need expensive things.  You just want them.
Josh:  What do you mean?
Cory:  I think you're spoiled.  You need to set some priorities.
