JASON: "Let's have another backyard barbeque this weekend."
JANE: "Ok. That sounds fun. Should we invite some friends?"
JASON: "Yeah, let's invite a few couples."
JANE: "OK. But we should buy some mosquito repellent this time."
JASON: "That's a good idea!"
JANE: "Do you remember what happened last time?"
JASON: "Yeah. Everyone was bitten by mosquitoes."
JANE: "It was awful. We were itchy for days."
JASON: "We used so much anti-itch cream."
JANE: "I think there are special candles that keep mosquitoes away. I saw a commercial for it a couple of days ago."
JASON: "Let's get those."
JANE: "Ok, I'll put it on the shopping list for the barbeque."
JASON: "Do you think our friends will come back to our party?"
JANE: "We'll have to tell them we have mosquito repellent this time."
JASON: "Mosquitoes are such pests. And, they carry diseases too."
JANE: "I know. Now I feel like having an indoor party."
JASON: "Don't let the mosquitoes win."
