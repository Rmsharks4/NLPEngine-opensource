Scott:  Today is my last day in this department.
Roy:  Where are you going?
Scott:  I'm transferring to a new department.
Roy:  Are you happy about that?
Scott:  Not really.  I like being in Customer Service, but they need help in Accounting.
Roy:  That's too bad.  Just try to do your best in your new position.
