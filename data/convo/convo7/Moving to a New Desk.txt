Hal:  I need to change my desk location.
Brendon:  What's wrong?
Hal:  David has an annoying habit of singing while he's working.
Brendon:  That's weird.
Hal:  I know.  It's so distracting too.
Brendon:  Have you talked to him?
Hal:  Yes, but he keeps doing it.
Brendon:  That's rude.
Hal:  I don't think David hears himself.  He always has earphones on.
Brendon:  I think there's an empty desk on the other side of the office.
