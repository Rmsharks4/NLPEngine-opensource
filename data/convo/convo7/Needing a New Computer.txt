MIKE: "I think I need a new computer."
GARY: "Why?"
MIKE: "Mine is so slow now. It takes a long time to start up and it keeps freezing."
GARY: "That's not good. How old is it?"
MIKE: "Several years old. It was a high school graduation gift from my parents."
GARY: "Yeah, it's probably time to replace it."
MIKE: "I don't know what to buy. There are so many different models these days."
GARY: "You should go to a computer store and ask about the different kinds?"
MIKE: "That's a good idea. Do you want to go with me?"
GARY: "When? I have to work today. Can you wait until tomorrow?"
MIKE: "Sure. I have to work until 5 pm tomorrow. Can you go around 6 o'clock tomorrow evening?"
GARY: "Yeah. Let's meet at your place at 6 pm."
MIKE: "Ok. I'll do some research on computers tonight."
GARY: "My brother just bought a brand new computer too. I can ask him if he likes it."
MIKE: "That would be great!"
GARY: "See you tomorrow around 6 pm."
