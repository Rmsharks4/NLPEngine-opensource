LINDA: "Something is wrong with my refrigerator."
SUE: "What's wrong with it?"
LINDA: "It's not staying cold."
SUE: "That could be a big problem."
LINDA: "I know. I'm worried that my food is going to spoil. I just went grocery shopping yesterday."
SUE: "I have room in my second refrigerator if you need to store some things."
LINDA: "You have two refrigerators?"
SUE: "Yeah. We needed two refrigerators because I cook a lot. There was a big sale at the appliance store, so we bought another one last week."
LINDA: "Is the sale still going on? I may need to buy a new one."
SUE: "Today is the last day of the sale."
LINDA: "Then I better tell my husband. We need to go today."
SUE: "Isn't your husband a great repairman. Maybe he can fix your refrigerator."
LINDA: "It's getting old. I'd rather buy a new one."
SUE: "If your husband can fix your broken one, you can have two refrigerators like me."
LINDA: "I don't cook that much."
