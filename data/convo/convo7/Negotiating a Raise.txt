Gary:  I have a meeting with the boss at noon.
Cathy:  Did she call a meeting with everyone?
Gary:  No.  I'm going to try to negotiate a raise.
Cathy:  She's not easy to negotiate with.
Gary:  I've worked here for two years and haven't received a raise yet.
Cathy:  She's not good at giving raises.  
Gary:  Well, that needs to change.  Do you have any tips for me?
Cathy:  Talk fast.  She's very impatient.
Gary:  I know exactly what I'm going to say and I'm ready!
Cathy:  Ok!  Good luck and let me know what happens.
