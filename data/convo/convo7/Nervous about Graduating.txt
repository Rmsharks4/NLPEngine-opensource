SEAN: "Can I tell you a secret, Alison?"
ALISON: "Sure. What is it, Sean? Is something wrong?"
SEAN: "I'm afraid to graduate."
ALISON: "Why? That's silly."
SEAN: "College was easy for me. Now we have to go out and find a real job."
ALISON: "That's the best part. We are finally adults."
SEAN: "Aren't you scared at all?"
ALISON: "No. I'm excited to work and plan my future."
SEAN: "I feel so immature."
ALISON: "Well, you are acting a little immature. It's time to grow up, Sean."
SEAN: "I know. Studying and taking tests were easy. Now we have to work for the rest of our lives."
ALISON: "You sound lazy. You're a really smart guy. You're going to have a great life."
SEAN: "Thanks for your encouragement. I feel silly."
ALISON: "You are being silly. If you are so scared of leaving school, why don't you go to graduate school?"
SEAN: "That's a great idea!"
ALISON: "It actually is. You'll get a better job with a graduate degree."
