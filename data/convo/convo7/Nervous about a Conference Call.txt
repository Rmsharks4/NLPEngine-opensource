Tina:  I'm really nervous about this conference call.
Patrick:  Why?
Tina:  The CTO is going to join us.
Patrick:  I would be nervous too.
Tina:  I hope I don't say anything stupid.
Patrick:  You're smart.  Don't worry.
Tina:  When I'm nervous, I say silly things.
Patrick:  At least it's a phone call.  She can't see you.
Tina:  It's a video conference call.  She will be able to see me.
Patrick:  Oh.  Just look confident.
