HELEN: "I can't believe tomorrow is the first day of the New Year!"
JANE: "I know! 2015 went by so fast."
HELEN: "It did. Have you made a New Year's resolution yet?"
JANE: "What is that?"
HELEN: "A goal you want to set or achieve in the New Year. Haven't you ever made a New Year's resolution?"
JANE: "No. Do you make one every year?"
HELEN: "Yes!"
JANE: "Do you achieve your goal every year?"
HELEN: "No, I hardly ever achieve them."
JANE: "What were they?"
HELEN: "One year was losing weight. Another year, I was going to quit smoking. There are too many to list."
JANE: "If you can't achieve them, why do you make one every year?"
HELEN: "I should at least try to achieve one goal."
JANE: "Was there ever a successful resolution?"
HELEN: "Let me think about it. I don't think so."
JANE: "Then your resolution for the New Year should be not to make any more resolutions."
HELEN: "Great idea!"
