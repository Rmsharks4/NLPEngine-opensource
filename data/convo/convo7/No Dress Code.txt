Linda:  Do we have a company dress code?
Susan:  No.  The president of the company doesn't care how you dress.
Linda:  Really?  You can wear jeans and t-shirts or shorts?
Susan:  Yeah.  He only cares about the quality of your work.
Linda:  That's great!  We had to wear suits to work every day at my old job.
Susan:  Even on Fridays?
Linda:  Yeah.  Our president was very conservative.
Susan:  Was that uncomfortable?
Linda:  Yes!  Wearing pantyhose every day is very uncomfortable.
Susan:  I know!
