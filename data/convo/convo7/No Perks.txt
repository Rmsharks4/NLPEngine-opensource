Henry:  Our company does not have very good perks.
Barry:  We have vacation time.
Henry:  My friend's company has paid vacation time plus bonuses, retirement plans, gym memberships, maternity leave, and much more.
Barry:  Wow!  We don't get any of those.  
Henry:  I know.  
Barry:  Maybe we should try to get a job there.
Henry:  I've tried.  I applied three times and had no luck.
Barry:  Why?
Henry:  There are thousands of applicants every month.
