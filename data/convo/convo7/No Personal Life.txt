Emma:  I'm so stressed right now.
Stella:  Why?  Is there something wrong?
Emma:  I'm so busy at work.  I'm forgetting about my personal life.
Stella:  I understand.  That happened to me too.
Emma:  How do you balance it all out?
Stella:  I just set a strict schedule.  Work is work and home is home.
Emma:  It's not that easy.
Stella:  I know.  But if you don't do that, you're going to get sick.
Emma:  I think that's my problem.  I feel sick all the time.
