Michael:  Are you sick?
Nick:  No.  I just ate too much.
Michael:  Why do you always eat so much?
Nick:  I always overeat during the holidays.
Michael:  You need to control yourself.
Nick:  I know, but Mom's cooking is the best.
Michael:  She made pumpkin pie, your favorite dessert.
Nick:  I don't think I have room for dessert.
Michael:  Really?  That's the first time I have ever heard you say that.
