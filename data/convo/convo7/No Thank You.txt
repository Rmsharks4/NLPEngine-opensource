Frank:  You have to try this.  
Donna:  What is it?
Frank:  Stuffed mushrooms.
Donna:  No, thank you.  I don't like mushrooms.
Frank:  What's wrong with them?
Donna:  They taste weird and they have a strange texture.
Frank:  Strange texture?
Donna:  Feels like a sponge in my mouth.
Frank:  This is all I made for dinner.  You're going to be hungry.  
Donna:  I guess I will get something to eat later.
