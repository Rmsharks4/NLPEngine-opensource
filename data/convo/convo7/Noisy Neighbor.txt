Chris:  I'm sick and tired of the noisy neighbor upstairs.
Karen:  His music is so loud.
Chris:  Let's talk to the apartment manager again.
Karen:  He's not going to do anything.  
Chris:  Then we should move.
Karen:  But the rent is cheap here.
Chris:  Well, we have to choose between cheap rent or a quiet apartment.
Karen:  That's a tough choice.
Chris:  No, it's not.  We can find another cheap place.
Karen:  What if we find another place with a noisy neighbor?
