MARK: "What's wrong Billy?"
BILLY: "I just found out that I won't be graduating this year."
MARK: "Why?"
BILLY: "I'm a few credits short of the graduation requirements."
MARK: "What are you going to do?"
BILLY: "There's nothing I can do right now."
MARK: "Have you told your parents?"
BILLY: "No way. They are going to be so mad."
MARK: "Well, you have to tell them."
BILLY: "I know. I just don't know how? My last report card was bad. I promised that I would improve my grades."
MARK: "Can you go to summer school?"
BILLY: "I will have to. They're probably going to take my car away."
MARK: "Good luck, buddy."
BILLY: "Thanks. I'm going to need it. Do you have an extra room at your house?"
MARK: "Why?"
BILLY: "I may need that too."
