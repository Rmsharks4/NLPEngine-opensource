KATE: "Hello?"
MARY: "Hi Kate. This is Mary. Are you busy?"
KATE: "No. Why?"
MARY: "Do you know anything about computers?"
KATE: "It depends. What's the matter?"
MARY: "My computer is running really slow. I don't know what's going on."
KATE: "Have you tried to restart it?"
MARY: "Yeah. But it's still slow."
KATE: "Do you think it was infected by a virus?"
MARY: "I don't think so. I scanned it for viruses."
KATE: "I think you should have a professional take a look at it."
MARY: "Yeah. Maybe it's time to get a new computer. This one is really old."
KATE: "How old is it?"
MARY: "Ten years?"
KATE: "Ten years. I think that's the problem."
MARY: "I think you're right. I guess it's time to buy a new one."
KATE: "We just bought a new one. It works great. Do you want to come over and take a look?"
MARY: "That would be wonderful. I'll be right over."
