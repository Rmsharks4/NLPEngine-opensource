KATIE: "Hi Sylvia. Mark and I are celebrating our one-year anniversary today."
SYLVIA: "Congratulations! What are you going to do?"
KATIE: "I don't know. Mark says he has a special surprise."
SYLVIA: "What do you think it is?"
KATIE: "I have no idea. Maybe dinner at a nice restaurant."
SYLVIA: "That would be lovely."
KATIE: "Yeah, we've both been so busy at work. Our first year of marriage went by very fast."
SYLVIA: "Yes, marriage can go by quickly."
KATIE: "How long have you been married?"
SYLVIA: "25 years."
KATIE: "Wow! That's a long time."
SYLVIA: "Yeah, it is. We've had our good and bad times, but we're happy."
KATIE: "That's great! I hope Mark and I will celebrate a 25-year anniversary one day."
SYLVIA: "I'm sure you will."
KATIE: "I just got a text from Mark. He said to put on a nice dress and dancing shoes."
SYLVIA: "Looks like you're going dancing."
KATIE: "That's a huge surprise."
SYLVIA: "Why?"
KATIE: "Because I love dancing, but Mark hates dancing!"
