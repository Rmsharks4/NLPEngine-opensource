Karen:  You got another package today.
Bella:  Great!
Karen:  What did you order this time?
Bella:  Books, clothes, and shoes.
Karen:  Wow!  That's a lot of stuff.
Bella:  I love to shop online.  Shipping is fast and free.
Karen:  But don't you want to try clothes and shoes on before you buy them?
Bella:  I can just return them if I don't like them or they don't fit.
Karen:  That's seems like a waste of time to me.
Bella:  I love looking for deals without leaving home.
