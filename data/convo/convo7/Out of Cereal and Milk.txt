Danny:  Mom, can I have a bowl of cereal for breakfast?
Mom:  Sure.
Danny:  We're out of milk.
Mom:  I just went to the market a few days ago.
Danny:  I don't see any in the refrigerator.
Mom:  Did we really drink it that fast?
Danny:  I guess so.  
Mom:  I will pick some up later today.  Have some eggs instead.
Danny:  I can't find the eggs either.
Mom:  I can't believe I have to go grocery shopping again.
