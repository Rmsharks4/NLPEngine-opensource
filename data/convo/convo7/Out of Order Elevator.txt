Jacky:  I need to move.
Pamela:  Why?  I thought you loved your apartment.
Jacky:  My apartment elevator has been out of order for two weeks.
Pamela:  That's a long time.  You live on the top floor.
Jacky:  It's been hard bringing groceries home.
Pamela:  When is it going to be fixed?
Jacky:  The manager doesn't know. 
Pamela:  He needs to do something about it.
Jacky:  He doesn't care.  He lives on the first floor.
Pamela:  Tell him to walk up and down the stairs.  He may repair it quicker.
