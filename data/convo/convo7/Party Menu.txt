Tiffany:  What should we serve at the party?
Mike:  Big, juicy burgers.
Tiffany:  We should do salad too.
Mike: Why?  Who eats salad?
Tiffany:  Some of our friends are vegetarians.
Mike:  Salad is boring.
Tiffany:  We can have a salad bar with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, and other things.
Mike:  Ok.  That should work.
Tiffany:  We can all have salad.
Mike:  No way!  I want a big, juicy burger.
