STAN: "What are you doing, Carl?"
CARL: "I'm spraying my house with pesticide."
STAN: "Why?"
CARL: "We have an ant problem. They're everywhere."
STAN: "How did that happen?"
CARL: "I think we left some food around outside and it attracted ants. Now they're coming into the house."
STAN: "That's terrible."
CARL: "This morning, I found some on the kitchen counter."
STAN: "That pesticide is toxic. You should be careful."
CARL: "I know. That's why I'm wearing a mask. I need to take care of this problem as soon as possible."
STAN: "I understand. My parents had an ant problem a couple of years ago. They used that stuff too."
CARL: "Did it work?"
STAN: "Yeah, but it smelled bad for a few days. They were getting headaches. They came to stay with me."
CARL: "Oh, that's good to know. Maybe we will go stay at a hotel for a few days."
STAN: "You can stay with us if you want."
CARL: "No, that's ok. Carol is so upset because of the ants. I'll take her on a short trip."
STAN: "Good idea!"
