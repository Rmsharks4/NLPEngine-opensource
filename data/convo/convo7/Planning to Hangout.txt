JOHN: "Hello?"
STEVEN: "Hi John. This is Steven. What are you doing tonight?"
JOHN: "Hey Steven. Nothing much. I don't have any plans yet."
STEVEN: "Do you want to hang out?"
JOHN: "Sure. What did you have in mind?"
STEVEN: "I don't know. It's Friday and I'm bored."
JOHN: "Want to go to the movies?"
STEVEN: "Is there a good movie to see?"
JOHN: "Let's check the Internet."
STEVEN: "Ok. Let me log onto my computer."
JOHN: "Do you want to see a comedy or a drama?"
STEVEN: "Nothing sad or depressing. I had a hard work week. I want to see something funny."
JOHN: "I agree. Work was stressful for me too."
STEVEN: "There aren't any new comedies right now. I only see dramas and horror movies."
JOHN: "Yeah, that's all I see too."
STEVEN: "Hey, let's go to comedy club. My favorite comedian is performing tonight at the local theater."
JOHN: "That sounds great. What time?"
STEVEN: "It starts at 7 pm. Let's do dinner too."
JOHN: "Good idea! I'll meet you at your house at 5 pm."
STEVEN: "See you tonight."
