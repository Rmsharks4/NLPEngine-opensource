A: "Hey Joe. What are you doing?"
B: "Hi Mark. I'm getting ready to send a package."
A: "Do you need to go to the post office?"
B: "Yeah, but the line is usually very long."
A: "Where are you sending your package?"
B: "Overseas to Korea."
A: "Is it a big package?"
B: "Yeah. Some books and clothes for my nephew and nieces."
A: "That's nice."
B: "Do you think the line will be long today?"
A: "I think so. Today is Monday. Most people go on Monday since the post office is closed on Sunday."
B: "You're right! Maybe I should wait until tomorrow."
A: "I think that's a better idea."
B: "Thanks for reminding me. I don't like waiting in long lines."
A: "Me too."
B: "Do you want to go have lunch instead?"
A: "Sure."
B: "I'll be right back. I'm going to put my package away."
