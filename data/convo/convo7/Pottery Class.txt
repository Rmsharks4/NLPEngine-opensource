JOAN: "I'm taking a pottery class."
CATHY: "Cool! What have you made so far?"
JOAN: "A bowl, a vase, and a mug."
CATHY: "Do you like the class?"
JOAN: "Yes, it's a lot of fun. I'm going to make each member of my family a cup."
CATHY: "That's nice."
JOAN: "It's going to be their Christmas gifts."
CATHY: "Is it hard to do?"
JOAN: "It was hard at first, but then I got used to the pottery wheel."
CATHY: "What made you decide to take a pottery class?"
JOAN: "I like taking lots of different classes. I get bored."
CATHY: "I wish I could take a class. I'm so busy with work and school."
JOAN: "Maybe one day after you retire, you'll have some time."
CATHY: "Retirement sounds great."
JOAN: "It is, but it can be boring. I always have to find something to do."
CATHY: "You must have a lot of hobbies."
JOAN: "I do. My hobbies are sewing, quilting, scrapbooking, and now pottery-making."
CATHY: "Wow, you must have a lot of great homemade items."
JOAN: "I do. My closet is full of them."
