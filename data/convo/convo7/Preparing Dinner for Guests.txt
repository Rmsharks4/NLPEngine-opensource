ALICE: "Hey Sue. What are you doing today?"
SUE: "Hey Alice. I'm going to the market later. My husband's boss and his wife are coming over for dinner tonight."
ALICE: "Wow! What are you making?"
SUE: "I don't know. His wife is a vegetarian, so I need to make one dish without meat."
ALICE: "My mother-in-law is a vegetarian. I can ask her for some recipes."
SUE: "That would be great. I'm a little nervous about hosting dinner."
ALICE: "You shouldn't worry. You're a great cook."
SUE: "I've never cooked for Jeff's boss before. I want to make sure everything is perfect."
ALICE: "I understand. I cooked for my boss once. It was a disaster. I burned the roast beef."
SUE: "Oh no! What happened?"
ALICE: "I was too busy talking and forgot to take it out of the oven. We all laughed, but I was so embarrassed."
SUE: "I'll make sure to use a timer."
ALICE: "Great idea!"
SUE: "I think I will make lasagna."
ALICE: "Your lasagna is delicious. My mother-in-law makes great vegetarian lasagna. I'll call her right now."
SUE: "Thank you so much! I'll go the market after you talk to her."
ALICE: "Good luck tonight."
