Besty:  I have to do a book report.
Emma:  What is the book?
Besty:  I haven't found one yet.
Emma:  How about a classic like Moby Dick?
Besty:  Who wrote that?
Emma:  Herman Melville.  
Besty:  I've never heard of him.
Emma:  I can lend it to you.
Besty:  That would be great!
Emma:  I have many other books.  You can come by and see what I have.
Besty:  Thank you so much!
