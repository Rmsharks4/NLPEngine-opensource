June:  Have you heard from Bill, the recruiter you met at the networking event?
Jonny:  No.  
June:  When did you send him your resume?
Jonny:  Three weeks ago.
June:  Why don't you ask Bill if he received it?
Jonny:  I did.  I sent him a follow-up email one week later.
June:  Did he respond to that?
Jonny:  No.  
June:  Well, that's rude.
Jonny:  I know.  Bill made many promises he didn't keep.
