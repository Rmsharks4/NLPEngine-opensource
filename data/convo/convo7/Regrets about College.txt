Bill:  I never finished college.
Sam:  Why?
Bill:  My dad got sick and I had to take care of my mom.
Sam:  Why didn't you go back to school later?
Bill:  After my dad died I had to take over the family business.
Sam:  But you're successful without a college degree.
Bill:  I know, but I still wish I had a college education.
Sam:  I understand.
Bill:  It's my biggest regret in life.
Sam:  It's not too late to get your degree.
