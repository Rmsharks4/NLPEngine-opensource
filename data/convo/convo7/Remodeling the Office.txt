Sharon:  I'm meeting with an architect today.
Kate:  Why?  Are you remodeling your house?
Sharon:  No.  We are going to remodel the office.
Kate:  That's a good idea.  The layout is not very good.
Sharon:  I know.  Some areas are too small and some are just a waste of space.
Kate:  I agree.  Can I get a bigger office?
