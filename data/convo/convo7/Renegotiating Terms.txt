Customer:  I notice we are paying a lot for delivery charges each month.
Sales clerk:  We can give you a discount depending on how much you order per month.
Customer:  We've been a good customer for over five years.
Sales clerk:  Yes, I see your order history.
Customer:  Can you waive the delivery fee for all future orders?
Sales clerk:  I don't know if I can do that.  I will talk to my manager and get back to you.
