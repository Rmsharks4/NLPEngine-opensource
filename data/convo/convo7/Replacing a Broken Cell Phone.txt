CAROL: "Hello?"
JANE: "Hi Carol. This is Jane. What are you doing today?"
CAROL: "I have to go to the mall. I broke my phone."
JANE: "What happened?"
CAROL: "I dropped it outside on the concrete ground."
JANE: "Oh no! That's terrible."
CAROL: "I hope it can be fixed or I have to buy a new one."
JANE: "Would you like me to go with you?"
CAROL: "Sure. If they can't fix it, maybe you can help me pick out a new phone."
JANE: "Ok. Do you want to have lunch together afterwards?"
CAROL: "I don't think I will have time. I have to pick up my children from school at 3 pm."
JANE: "How about tomorrow?"
CAROL: "Tomorrow is better. Where do you want to go?"
JANE: "You pick the restaurant. It will be my treat since you're having a bad day."
CAROL: "Thanks! That's so nice of you."
JANE: "My pleasure. Let's go check out the phone store."
