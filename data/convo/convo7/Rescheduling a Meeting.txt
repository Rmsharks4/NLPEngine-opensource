Nancy:  I'm sorry but can we reschedule our meeting?
Janet:  Sure.  Is something wrong?
Nancy:  My husband is having surgery that day.
Janet:  I'm sorry to hear that.
Nancy:  It's not serious, but I need to stay home with him.
Janet:  I understand.  Let's reschedule when your husband is fully recovered.
