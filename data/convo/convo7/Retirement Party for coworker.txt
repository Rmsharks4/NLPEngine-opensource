CHARLIE: "Are you going to Bill's retirement party?"
LINDA: "No. Are you?"
CHARLIE: "I don't know. I don't think many people are going."
LINDA: "He isn't a very nice person and he's a mean boss."
CHARLIE: "I know. I remember when he yelled at me for being 10 minutes late to a presentation."
LINDA: "Weren't you in a car accident that morning."
CHARLIE: "Yeah. I was pretty angry."
LINDA: "He would yell at people for unnecessary reasons."
CHARLIE: "Why is the company throwing him a retirement party?"
LINDA: "I don't know. I think his secretary, Mary, is planning it."
CHARLIE: "She must be crazy."
LINDA: "Maybe she is happy he is leaving, so she wants to have a party."
CHARLIE: "That's funny. Then we should all go."
LINDA: "Maybe we should."
CHARLIE: "That's a sad way to retire."
LINDA: "What is a sad way to retire?"
CHARLIE: "To retire with no one liking you."
LINDA: "You're right. Maybe we should go to the party and say goodbye."
