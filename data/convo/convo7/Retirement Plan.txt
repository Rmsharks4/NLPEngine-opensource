Steven:  I have to plan for my retirement.
Matthew:  Have you thought about investing in stocks?
Steven:  Yeah, but stocks can be risky.
Matthew:  I know.  My brother lost a lot of money in stocks.
Steven:  That's what I'm worried about.
Matthew:  However, I also know a few people who made a lot of money investing in stocks.
Steven:  I guess it's a gamble.
Matthew:  You have to be smart.
Steven:  You also have to be lucky!
Matthew:  That's right!
