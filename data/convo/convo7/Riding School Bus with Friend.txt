MOM: "Hi Billy, how was your first day at a new school?"
BILLY: "It was ok, Mom."
MOM: "Did you make any new friends?"
BILLY: "Yeah. A boy in my class."
MOM: "Is he nice? What's his name?"
BILLY: "He's cool. His name is Brian. He plays soccer."
MOM: "You love soccer. You were on the soccer team at your old school."
BILLY: "Yeah, I miss my old team with Ted, Mark, and Richard."
MOM: "I know you do. Do you want to invite Brian over to play one day?"
BILLY: "Sure. He rides the school bus on our street."
MOM: "Do you want to start riding the school bus too."
BILLY: "Yeah. Then I can meet more of the neighborhood kids."
MOM: "Ok. Let's plan for you to ride the bus tomorrow morning."
BILLY: "Brian said the bus comes at 7:45."
MOM: "Then you need to wake up at 7 o'clock."
BILLY: "I know. I'll set my alarm."
