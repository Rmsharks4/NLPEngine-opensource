Debbie:  I am so mad!  My kids were playing in our yard and they stepped in dog poop.
Heather:  You don't have a dog.
Debbie:  I know.  Someone is leaving dog poop in our yard.
Heather:  That's terrible.  
Debbie:  It has happened twice already.
Heather:  What are you going to do?
Debbie:  I'm going to set up a secret video recorder in our yard.
Heather:  What are you going to do when you find out who it is? 
Debbie:  I'm going to deliver their dog's mess to them and show them the video.
Heather:  They are going to be so embarrassed.
