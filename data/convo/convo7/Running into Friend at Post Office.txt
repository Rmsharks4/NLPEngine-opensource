A: "Hey Robert. What are you doing here?"
B: "Hi Kevin. I need to buy some stamps. What about you?"
A: "I was checking my post office box, but my key won't work."
B: "Do you know why?"
A: "I think they canceled my account because I forgot to pay."
B: "That's too bad."
A: "Yeah. I use it for my business."
B: "How long have you been waiting?"
A: "I've been here since 8 am."
B: "That's 30 minutes."
A: "I know. It's been a long wait."
B: "There are still several people ahead of us."
A: "Many people left. They were tired of waiting."
B: "I don't think I can wait either. I have a dentist appointment at 9 am."
A: "I'm going to wait. I need to re-open my account."
B: "Yeah. I understand. I'm going to come back later."
A: "Ok. See you another time."
B: "Bye Kevin."
