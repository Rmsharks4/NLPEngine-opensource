Heather:  What is going on?  Who are all these people?
Sam:  The company's security team.
Heather:  What happened?
Sam:  You didn't hear the news?  The company's database was hacked.
Heather:  What does that mean?
Sam:  That means someone got access to our data without the company's authorization.
Heather:  Who has been affected?
Sam:  Customers and employees.
Heather:  That's awful!
Sam:  I know.  Our company could get sued.
