A: "Hi Carol. What are you doing?"
B: "Hi Jane. I'm making a shopping list for the supermarket."
A: "I need to go too. But my car is at the repair shop."
B: "What's wrong with it?"
A: "Nothing serious. Just an oil change."
B: "Do you want to join me?"
A: "Sure. Which one are you going to?"
B: "ABC Grocery. I have coupons for that market."
A: "Let me check my purse and see if I have any coupons too."
B: "You can get good deals on a lot of things if you have their coupons."
A: "I know. I use their coupons all the time."
B: "So, do you have any?"
A: "No. I think I used them all. Where did you get your coupons?"
B: "They came in the mail today. Have you looked in your mail box?"
A: "No, not yet. I'll go do that right now. What time are you leaving?"
B: "Don't worry. I can wait for you."
A: "Thanks. I'll be right back."
