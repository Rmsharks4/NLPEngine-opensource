SUE: "Hello?"
LINDA: "Hi Sue. This is Linda. Are you free for lunch today?"
SUE: "No, David is sick today. He couldn't go to school."
LINDA: "That's terrible. Is it a cold?"
SUE: "Yeah, I think so. He has a cough and a sore throat."
LINDA: "My son, Billy, was sick last week too. He missed four days of school."
SUE: "Wow! I hope David isn't sick that long."
LINDA: "There's a virus going around. We need to stay healthy too."
SUE: "I know. I've been taking extra Vitamin C to stay healthy."
LINDA: "Good idea! I think I'll buy some today. Do you need anything at the store?"
SUE: "Actually, I do. I couldn't go to the store because I didn't want to leave David alone."
LINDA: "I understand. What do you need?"
SUE: "Could you please buy me a whole chicken?  I want to make David some chicken soup."
LINDA: "That's a great idea! I'll drop it off on my way home."
SUE: "Thank you so much! I will pay you back when you drop off the chicken."
LINDA: "Ok! I'm going to go to the store after lunch. I will be at your house around 2 pm."
SUE: "Great! See you then. Don't forget to buy Vitamin C!"
