JANE: "Hello?"
KATE: "Hi Jane. This is Kate. I'm not going to school today."
JANE: "Why, Kate? Are you sick?"
KATE: "No. My grandfather had a heart attack this morning. I have to go to the hospital with my parents."
JANE: "Oh, I see. I'm sorry to hear that. Can I help you with anything?"
KATE: "Actually, yes. Could you pick up any homework assignments I may miss?"
JANE: "Sure. How many days do you think you'll miss class?"
KATE: "I don't know yet. We're not sure about his condition."
JANE: "Is the hospital close by?"
KATE: "No. It's a three-hour drive. My mom is packing some clothes just in case she needs to stay at the hospital overnight."
JANE: "I hope he recovers soon."
KATE: "Thanks. Well, I better go now. I'm going to e-mail our teacher and let him know too. I'll tell him to give any missed assignments to you."
JANE: "Ok. I'll take good notes in class and make copies for you."
KATE: "Thanks! That would wonderful."
JANE: "Let me know if you need anything else. Call me later."
KATE: "I will. Talk to you soon."
