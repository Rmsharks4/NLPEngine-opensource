JENNIFER: "Hi Susie. Where are you going? Are you taking a trip?"
SUSIE: "Yeah, I'm going to Chicago. My sister just had a baby. I'm going to be helping her for a couple of weeks."
JENNIFER: "That's so nice of you. Did she have a boy or a girl?"
SUSIE: "A girl. Her name is Rose."
JENNIFER: "What a beautiful name!"
SUSIE: "Yeah. She is named after our grandmother."
JENNIFER: "My daughter is also named after my grandmother. Her name is Marie."
SUSIE: "That's also a beautiful name."
JENNIFER: "Thanks. Is this your sister's first child?"
SUSIE: "Yeah. This is my first niece too. She's also the first grandchild in the family."
JENNIFER: "How special!"
SUSIE: "I know. My mother is so excited. She's only lives a few blocks away from my sister. So, she will be helping a lot too."
JENNIFER: "That's wonderful. It's nice to have a lot of help with your first child."
SUSIE: "Yeah. I agree. Well, I better go now. I have to be at the airport by 1 pm."
JENNIFER: "Ok. See you in two weeks."
