LINDA: "Hello?"
STACY: "Hi Linda. This is Stacy. Are you free tomorrow night?"
LINDA: "No, I'm not. Why?"
STACY: "I'm inviting a couple of friends to sleep over."
LINDA: "I wish I could go, but I have to babysit my younger sister."
STACY: "That's too bad. We were going to rent a movie and order pizza."
LINDA: "Now I really wish I could go. That sounds like so much fun."
STACY: "Can your parents find another babysitter?"
LINDA: "No. Our regular babysitter got sick, so they asked me."
STACY: "I see. What time will your parents be back?"
LINDA: "9 o'clock pm."
STACY: "Do you want to come over after you finish babysitting?"
LINDA: "Will you still be awake?"
STACY: "Of course! It's a sleepover party. We're all going to sleep late."
LINDA: "Ok! Please save me some pizza."
STACY: "I will. See you tomorrow night."
