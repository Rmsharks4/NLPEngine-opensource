JANE: "Hi Carol. Did you get a new car?"
CAROL: "Hi Jane. No, this is a rental car. I was in an auto accident yesterday."
JANE: "Are you ok?"
CAROL: "Yeah. My back hurts a little, but luckily I wasn't seriously injured."
JANE: "Did you go to the hospital?"
CAROL: "Yeah. I went there this morning. The doctor took some did x-rays. Nothing is serious. I just have some bruises."
JANE: "I'm glad you are ok. Was there another car involved?"
CAROL: "Yeah, the other driver rear-ended me at a red light."
JANE: "Wow! Is he or she ok?"
CAROL: "Yeah. He seemed ok at the scene."
JANE: "This could've been a serious accident."
CAROL: "I know. We were both lucky."
JANE: "Where is your car? Is it getting fixed?"
CAROL: "No. It's too damaged to be repaired. It's at the junkyard now."
JANE: "That's terrible. Is your insurance going to pay for a new car?"
CAROL: "Well, it was the other driver's fault, so his insurance is going to take care of it."
JANE: "That's good. Are you going to buy the same type of car?"
CAROL: "I think so. I loved that car. It protected me in this accident."
