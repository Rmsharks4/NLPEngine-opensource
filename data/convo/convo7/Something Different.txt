Ben:  We go to the mountains every year.
Cynthia:  Do you want to try something different this year?
Ben:  Let's go somewhere warm. 
Cynthia:  Where should we go?
Ben:  How about the beach?  My co-worker owns a condo on the beach.
Cynthia:  That sounds nice.
Ben:  He said he would give us a discount on the cost.
Cynthia:  We can celebrate our anniversary there.
Ben:  That's a great idea!
Cynthia:  We haven't been to the beach in a long time.
