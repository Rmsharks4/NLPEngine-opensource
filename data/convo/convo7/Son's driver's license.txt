TOM: "My son is taking his driver's license test today."
BILL: "Is he nervous?"
TOM: "He's a little nervous."
BILL: "It's normal to be nervous."
TOM: "I told him that. He just wants to pass the test, so he can start driving to school."
BILL: "Does he have a car?"
TOM: "No, he has to share with my wife."
BILL: "Are you going to get him a car?"
TOM: "No, not yet. First, he has to show us that he is a responsible driver."
BILL: "Did your auto insurance go up a lot?"
TOM: "Yes! Our insurance rate doubled."
BILL: "Wow! Are you serious?"
TOM: "Yes, that's what makes me nervous. I don't know how we'll be able to afford insurance when my younger son starts to drive."
BILL: "When will that be?"
TOM: "In two years."
BILL: "Better start saving or better have your sons get part-time jobs."
TOM: "I think I like the part-time job idea better."
