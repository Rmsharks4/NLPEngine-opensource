RICK: "Hey Joe. What are you doing for Spring Break?"
JOE: "I'm going to Florida with some friends. Do you want to join us, Rick?"
RICK: "Sure! That sounds like fun. I need to ask my parents first."
JOE: "Ok. Let me know later. We're going to leave on Friday at 3 pm."
RICK: "Where are we going to stay?"
JOE: "My parents own a beach house. They said I could invite a few friends."
RICK: "That's nice! How many people are going?"
JOE: "I'm inviting four people including you."
RICK: "Are your parents going to be there?"
JOE: "Yeah. They want to be there just in case there is an emergency."
RICK: "What should I bring?"
JOE: "Clothes, swimsuit, and a surfboard."
RICK: "I don't have a surfboard."
JOE: "I think you can rent one at the beach. Do you know how to surf?"
RICK: "Yeah. I've done it a few times."
JOE: "Cool."
RICK: "Let me call my parents. I'll text you later."
JOE: "Ok. It's going to be fun."
