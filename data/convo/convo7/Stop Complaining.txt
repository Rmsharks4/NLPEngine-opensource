Lola:  Stop complaining.  It's not that bad.
Tiffany:  Is there anything else to watch?
Lola:  I like this show.  Give it a chance.
Tiffany:  There is just too much singing.
Lola:  It's a musical.  There's supposed to be singing.
Tiffany:  How can you watch this?
Lola:  I like musicals.  Are you going to continue complaining?
Tiffany:  No.  I'll stop, but I get to choose the show next time.
