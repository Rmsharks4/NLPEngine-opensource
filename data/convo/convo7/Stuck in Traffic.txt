Ian:  I'm stuck in traffic again.
Cathy:  Why?  Is there an accident?
Ian:  I don't know.  I don't see anything.
Cathy:  Should I cancel our dinner reservations?
Ian:  No.  Can you try to change it for a later time?
Cathy:  I will call the restaurant and ask them.
Ian:  Ok.  The cars are moving again.
Cathy:  Don't drive while talking on your cell phone.  It's dangerous.
Ian:  Ok.  I will see you soon.
Cathy:  Drive safely.
