A: "Hi Jane. Where are you going?"
B: "Hi Sandra. I'm heading to the market."
A: "Which one?"
B: "The one down the street."
A: "Today is a good day to go. There are a lot of items on sale."
B: "That's great to know. I need to buy a lot of stuff."
A: "The market is going out of business?"
B: "Why?"
A: "Not enough customers."
B: "That's not good. I always go to that market."
A: "Me too. But more people are going to the bigger market a few blocks away."
B: "It's always so crowded there."
A: "I know. But it has a bigger selection of things."
B: "Yeah, but I still like the smaller store."
A: "Well, you better leave soon. There were a lot of people today because of the big sale."
B: "Ok. Thanks for letting me know. I'll see you later."
