KATHY: "Hello?"
MOM: "Hi Kathy. This is Mom. Are you and Phil free on Friday night?"
KATHY: "We're having dinner with friends. Why? What's going on?"
MOM: "Your dad's co-workers are throwing him a surprise retirement party."
KATHY: "Really? That's so nice of them."
MOM: "I know. I was hoping you and Phil could attend."
KATHY: "Of course we will. I'll reschedule the dinner party."
MOM: "That would be wonderful. But remember it's a surprise. So, don't tell him."
KATHY: "I won't. Is Dad sad about retiring?"
MOM: "No. He is actually looking forward to it. He has worked a long time."
KATHY: "Yeah. I remember all of those long hours he worked."
MOM: "He was a great employee. They're going to miss him at the office."
KATHY: "What are you and Dad going to do now?"
MOM: "I think we're going to take a trip to Hawaii."
KATHY: "That's good! It's a great place to relax."
MOM: "It sure is. We even talked about retiring there."
KATHY: "Really? That would be awesome!"
MOM: "You and your family could vacation in Hawaii. You'll have a free place to stay."
KATHY: "Mom, that sounds awesome. But I'll miss you both."
MOM: "Yeah, that's the only bad thing."
