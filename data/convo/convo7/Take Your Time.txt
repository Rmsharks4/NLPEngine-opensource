Sean:  I need some tips on negotiating.
Glen:  Ok.  Don't be in a hurry to end negotiations.
Sean:  Why?  I hate negotiating.  I want it to be over quickly.
Glen:  If you're in a rush, you're more likely to make mistakes.
Sean:  That's true.  I made a bad deal once because I was in a hurry.
Glen:  If you show them patience, they will think you are not under pressure to make a quick deal.  They will start to give you what you want because they think you don't need their offer.
Sean:  That's also true.  This is great advice.
Glen:  Just take your time.  There's a lot of money involved, so you don't want to make any mistakes in your negotiations.
Sean:  Thank you!  These are great negotiating tips!
