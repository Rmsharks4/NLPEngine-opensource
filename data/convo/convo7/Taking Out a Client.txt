Matt:  Sure.  What time is his flight?
Catherine:  5PM.
Matt:  5 PM?  That's rush hour.
Catherine:  I know.  I'm sorry about that.
Matt:  Where do I drop him off?
Catherine:  His hotel is downtown.
Matt:  Downtown?  I need to come back downtown during rush hour?
Catherine:  Yes, please.  Would you also be able to take him out to dinner?  
Matt:  Dinner too?   
Catherine:  Yes.   You can borrow the company car.
