Kevin:  Is Richard in his office?
Sharon:  No.  He's in a meeting.
Kevin:  I need to talk to him about my start time.  I need to start an hour later.
Sharon:  Why?
Kevin:  Sheila is going back to work and I need to be home until my son leaves for school.
Sharon:  I'm sure Richard will be fine with that.  He's a single dad, so he will understand.
