Polly:  Can you take the kids to school today?  
Hal:  Sure.  
Polly:  The plumber is coming at 8 AM.  I need to be home.
Hal:  Ok.  Do I drop Kevin off first?
Polly:  Yes.  When you drop Katie off, you have to walk her to her classroom.
Hal:  Why?
Polly:  Because she is in kindergarten and the school does not allow them to be dropped off in the parking lot.
Hal:  That's right.  I forgot.  
Polly:  Looks like you need to drop the kids off at school more often.
Hal:  I think they need to take the bus to school.
