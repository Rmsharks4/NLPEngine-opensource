Patrick:  Why is this elevator so slow?
Lucia:  How long have you been waiting?
Patrick:  10 minutes.
Lucia:  This is a very old building.  
Patrick:  I don't have time to wait.  I'm going to take the stairs.
Lucia:  We're on the 18th floor!
Patrick:  I don't care.  I'm going to be late for work.
Lucia:  I'll come with you.
Patrick:  Ok, but you're wearing high heels.
Lucia:  I'll wait for the elevator.
Patrick:  Good luck.
