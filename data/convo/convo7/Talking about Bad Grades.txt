JACK: "Hey Dave. Did you get your report card?"
DAVE: "Hey Jack. Yeah."
JACK: "How did you do in Math?"
DAVE: "I did well. How about you?"
JACK: "I didn't do too well. I failed the class."
DAVE: "How? What happened?"
JACK: "I think I failed the final exam."
DAVE: "I'm sorry to hear that. What are you going to do?"
JACK: "I have to take the class again during the summer or I can't graduate."
DAVE: "Are you serious? That's terrible."
JACK: "I was supposed to go on a vacation with my older brother.  We were going to go to Europe, but now I won't be able to."
DAVE: "I don't have any plans for the summer. I can help you if you need it."
JACK: "Thanks. That would be nice."
DAVE: "Do you know when summer school starts?"
JACK: "I think it starts at the end of June."
DAVE: "That's right after regular school ends."
JACK: "I know. I won't have much time to enjoy my summer, but I need to graduate."
DAVE: "Don't worry. I'll help you."
