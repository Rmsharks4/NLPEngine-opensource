STEVE: "Hey John! Did you see the fish Sam just caught?"
JOHN: "No. What did he catch? How big was it?"
STEVE: "A 20 pound salmon."
JOHN: "Wow! I've been here all day and have caught nothing. Have you caught anything?"
STEVE: "Yeah, just a couple of small trout."
JOHN: "That's better than me. I just want to give up and go home."
STEVE: "Don't give up. You might catch something soon."
JOHN: "My wife told me to bring home dinner."
STEVE: "Fish?"
JOHN: "Yeah. I may have to go to the market and buy one."
STEVE: "That's silly. Just wait."
JOHN: "The sun is starting to set and I'm tired of being out here."
STEVE: "At least it didn't rain today. We had clear skies all day."
JOHN: "That's true. It was nice today. Hey, can you hold my fishing pole? I need to go to the restroom."
STEVE: "Sure. Wait, John!"
JOHN: "Steve, what?"
STEVE: "Something is pulling on your fishing pole! Here, grab it!"
JOHN: "Wow! That's a huge salmon!"
STEVE: "I told you to be patient and you would catch something."
JOHN: "Now I can take home dinner. Want to come over and have salmon with us?"
