ANNE: "Hi Kate. Why do you look so tired?"
KATE: "Oh hi Anne. We just got back from the emergency room."
ANNE: "Why? What happened?"
KATE: "Jason had to get stitches."
ANNE: "Why? Did he cut himself?"
KATE: "Yeah, he was slicing some onions and the knife slipped. He got a really deep cut on his finger."
ANNE: "That sounds painful."
KATE: "The painful part was waiting at the emergency room. There was only one doctor working tonight. We waited three hours."
ANNE: "What about his finger?"
KATE: "The nurse wrapped it with a bandage to stop the bleeding."
ANNE: "I hate the ER. It is always crowded and takes too long."
KATE: "I know.  But, I knew he had to have stitches. It was a really bad cut, so we had to stay."
ANNE: "How many stitches did he get?"
KATE: "Nine. He won't be able to play video games for a few weeks."
ANNE: "Is that a good thing?"
KATE: "Actually, it is. But he's not happy about it."
