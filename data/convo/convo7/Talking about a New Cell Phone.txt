JAMES: "Hi Mike. What are you doing?"
MIKE: "Hi James. I got a new cell phone. I'm reading the manual."
JAMES: "That's a nice phone."
MIKE: "Thanks. I really like it."
JAMES: "I need to get a new one too. My phone is old."
MIKE: "Would you like to look at my phone?"
JAMES: "That would be great."
MIKE: "Be careful with it."
JAMES: "Don't worry. I will."
MIKE: "It is very light. It has a lot of functions."
JAMES: "I like your phone. How much did it cost?"
MIKE: "It was expensive. It was $100."
JAMES: "Wow! That's too much for me. I think I will wait for a sale."
MIKE: "This was a gift from my parents. It was my birthday yesterday."
JAMES: "Oh, happy birthday!"
MIKE: "Thanks!"
JAMES: "Let's get some ice cream to celebrate."
MIKE: "Ok. I'm tired of reading this manual. I need a break."
