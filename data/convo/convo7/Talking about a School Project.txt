KATE: "Hello?"
ANNE: "Hi Kate. This is Anne. Have you completed the class project?"
KATE: "Yeah. I finished it last night. How about you?"
ANNE: "No, not yet. I'm having a hard time with the conclusion of my report."
KATE: "Do you need any help?"
ANNE: "Maybe just a little. Do you have time tonight?"
KATE: "No. I'm sorry. It's my aunt and uncle's anniversary and I promised to babysit my niece."
ANNE: "Oh. I understand."
KATE: "I'm free tomorrow night."
ANNE: "Tomorrow is good for me too. Can I come over or would you like to come here."
KATE: "It might be quieter at your house. My brother is going to have a friend over and they can be very noisy."
ANNE: "Ok. Then let's meet at my house."
KATE: "Sounds good. What time should I come over?"
ANNE: "How about 5 pm? I can make you dinner."
KATE: "Really? I'd love to come for dinner."
ANNE: "What's your favorite dish?"
KATE: "Spaghetti and meatballs. But please make anything you like."
ANNE: "Spaghetti and meatballs are my specialty. I'll make that."
KATE: "Sounds great! I will be there tomorrow at 5 pm."
ANNE: "See you tomorrow night."
