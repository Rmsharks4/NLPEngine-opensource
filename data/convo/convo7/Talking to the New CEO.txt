Robert:  Yes.  He's talking to the vice-president of the company.
Nick:  I'm going to go introduce myself.
Robert:  Are you crazy?  They won't know you.
Nick:  That's why I'm going to introduce myself.
Robert:  Good luck.  
Nick:  I want to be a manager one day.  This is one way to move up the ladder.
Robert:  Ok.  Let me know how the conversation goes.
