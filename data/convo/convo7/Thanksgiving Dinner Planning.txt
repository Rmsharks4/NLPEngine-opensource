LINDA: "Hello?"
MOM: "Hi Linda. This is Mom."
LINDA: "Hi Mom. How are you doing?"
MOM: "Oh, I'm fine. I'm just planning the menu for the Thanksgiving dinner."
LINDA: "What can I help you with this year?"
MOM: "Would you like to bring your delicious pumpkin pies again? Everyone loved them last year."
LINDA: "Sure. Is there anything else?"
MOM: "No, I think your sisters are bringing salads and other side dishes."
LINDA: "Ok. Will our cousins be joining us?"
MOM: "I don't think so. I think they have to go to visit their In-laws this year."
LINDA: "Ok. How many pumpkin pies should I bring?"
MOM: "Maybe three? That should be plenty."
LINDA: "Ok. Are you roasting a big turkey this year?"
MOM: "Yeah, probably around 20 pounds."
LINDA: "Wow! That's big."
MOM: "I like having leftovers. I make turkey sandwiches and soups for your Dad."
LINDA: "Mom. I have a confession."
MOM: "What is it? Is it serious?"
LINDA: "I don't make my pumpkin pies. I buy them at the market."
MOM: "Oh, I know. The price tags were on the bottom of the pans."
