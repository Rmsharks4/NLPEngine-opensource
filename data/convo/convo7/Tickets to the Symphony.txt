JANE: "Hello?"
ANNE: "Hi Jane. This is Anne. Are you free tonight?"
JANE: "I have to work."
ANNE: "What time do you get off work?"
JANE: "7 pm. Why?"
ANNE: "I have tickets to the symphony. Would you like to go?"
JANE: "What time does it start?"
ANNE: "7 pm. Can you get off work a little early?"
JANE: "No, I'm the only one available tonight."
ANNE: "You can come late. I can drop off the ticket at your work."
JANE: "I might be really late. I have to go home first to shower and change my clothes. Then I have to drive all the way to the concert hall."
ANNE: "Oh. Maybe I should ask someone else this time."
JANE: "Yeah, that might be a better idea. I'm sorry."
ANNE: "My company gives us concert tickets all the time. Let's try to go next time."
JANE: "That sounds good. Have a great time!"
