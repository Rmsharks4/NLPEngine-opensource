Rhonda:  We need a new sink.  This one is leaking again.
Walter:  I'll call a plumber.
Rhonda:  Can we just buy a new sink?
Walter:  Why?
Rhonda:  This one is so old.  
Walter:  It's in good condition.
Rhonda:  No, it is not.  It is leaking again.
Walter:  We just need to fix the leak.
Rhonda:  We've fixed it three times already.
Walter:  You're right.  We need a new sink.
