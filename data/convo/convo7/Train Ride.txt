LINDA: "What are you doing this weekend?"
KATHY: "We're going to take the train to my mother's house."
LINDA: "That should be fun."
KATHY: "Yeah. We usually drive, but we decided to take the train this time."
LINDA: "Why?"
KATHY: "My son loves trains, so I thought it would be a good idea to take the train up there."
LINDA: "Does he have a train set?"
KATHY: "Oh yes. He has several trains and Jason built him a big wooden train track."
LINDA: "Then he's going to love this ride."
KATHY: "I know. We haven't told him yet. It's going to be a surprise."
LINDA: "I remember riding the train as a child. It was a lot of fun."
KATHY: "One of his toy trains looks just like the train we're going to take."
LINDA: "Make sure to take a picture of it."
KATHY: "That's a great idea. I'll frame it and hang it on his bedroom wall."
LINDA: "Have a great train ride!"
