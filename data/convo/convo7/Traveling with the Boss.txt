Jimmy:  I'm going on a business trip with my boss.
Erin:  How do you feel about that?
Jimmy:  Uncomfortable.  I've never traveled with my boss before.
Erin:  Did you get separate hotel rooms?
Jimmy:  Yes!  They are next to each other.
Erin:  Then what is the problem?
Jimmy:  We have to sit on the plane together and eat meals together.
Erin:  Your boss is really nice.  You shouldn't worry.
Jimmy:  I know.  I'm just afraid I'm going to make a bad impression.
Erin:  You're worrying too much.  Just be yourself.
