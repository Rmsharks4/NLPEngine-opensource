JAN: "Hello?"
TINA: "Hi Jan. This is Tina. Is Janice going trick-or-treating this year?"
JAN: "I think so."
TINA: "Cindy doesn't want to go?"
JAN: "Why?"
TINA: "She thinks it's for little kids."
JAN: "That's funny. She's only 9 years old."
TINA: "I know. She thinks it's for babies."
JAN: "Tell her that babies cannot eat candy."
TINA: "She said Halloween is boring."
JAN: "What if she changes her mind after Halloween is over? It's only once a year."
TINA: "Then she has to wait another year."
JAN: "Maybe Janice can talk to her."
TINA: "Where are you and Janice going?"
JAN: "Just around our neighborhood. There are a lot of homes around here."
TINA: "We live in an apartment. Maybe that's why it's boring. There aren't many kids here."
JAN: "Bring Cindy here on Halloween. We can all go together."
TINA: "What a great idea! Thanks!"
