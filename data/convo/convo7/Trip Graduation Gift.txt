CATHY: "Hi Carol. What are you doing at a travel agency? Are you planning a trip?"
CAROL: "Oh Hi Cathy. My son is graduating college and Joe and I thought a trip would be a good graduation gift."
CATHY: "That's a great graduation gift! He's a lucky boy."
CAROL: "He's a good son, so Bob and I wanted to give him something special."
CATHY: "Where are you sending him?"
CAROL: "China. He studied the Chinese language in college and really enjoyed learning about the culture."
CATHY: "Does he know anyone there?"
CAROL: "My brother moved there last year for work. He is going to show him around."
CATHY: "That's nice. It will be more fun if he knows someone there."
CAROL: "Yeah. And it will be safer too."
CATHY: "Does he know about this trip?"
CAROL: "No, it's going to be a surprise. So, if you see him, please don't mention anything."
CATHY: "I promise I won't."
CAROL: "Cathy, what are you doing here?"
CATHY: "I'm planning a trip to Hawaii. Bill and I go every summer."
CAROL: "Now that's being really lucky!"
