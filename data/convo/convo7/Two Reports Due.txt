Will:  Are you busy this weekend?
Stephanie:  Yeah.  I have two reports due on Monday.
Will:  Two reports?
Stephanie:  Yeah.  My boss just gave me another report to do.
Will:  That's a tight deadline.
Stephanie:  I know.  I'll be working all week and on the weekend.
Will:  That's not good.  
Stephanie:  It's ok.  I'm going on a vacation after I'm done.
Will:  That's a good idea!
Stephanie:  I'll be gone for one week and turning my cell phone off.
