Ted:  I have tickets to see the new action movie.  Would you like to join me?
Dan:  Sure!  When is it?
Ted:  This Saturday.  Are you available?
Dan:  No, I'm not.  I have to go to my sister's birthday party.
Ted:  That's too bad.  What time is the party?
Dan:  The party is at 5 o'clock.  
Ted:  We can see the late showing at 10.
Dan:  That sounds good.  The party will be over before 10.
Ted:  Let's meet at the theater at 9:30.
Dan:  Ok.  Thanks for inviting me.
