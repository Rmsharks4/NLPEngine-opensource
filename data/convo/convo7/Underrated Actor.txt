Esther:  He is my favorite actor.  
Pat:  He is a good actor, but he is not very popular.
Esther:  He is so underrated.  
Pat:  Why is he underrated?
Esther:  I think it is because he's not very handsome.
Pat:  I don't think that is true.  There are many popular actors who are not handsome.
Esther:  Maybe it is because he always plays the bad guy.  People like good guys.
Pat:  He is very good at playing an evil guy.
Esther:  That is what makes him a great actor.
Pat:  But he needs to play other types of roles.
