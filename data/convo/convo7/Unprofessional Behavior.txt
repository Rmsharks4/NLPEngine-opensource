Doug:  I think I made a mistake last night.
Sarah:  What did you do?
Doug:  I met a recruiter at an event and she thinks I asked her out on a date.
Sarah:  Why does she think that?
Doug:  I asked for her phone number and if she was available for lunch.  
Sarah:  You didn't make yourself very clear.  You need to act more professional.
