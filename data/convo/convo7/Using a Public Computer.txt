TIM: "Hey Charlie. Why are you in such a hurry?"
CHARLIE: "Hi Tim. I'm going to the school library."
TIM: "I was just at the library. I had to check out some books. It was really crowded today."
CHARLIE: "My computer isn't working and I need to finish a report."
TIM: "Good luck finding a spot. All the computers were taken when I was there."
CHARLIE: "Oh no! My report is due tomorrow."
TIM: "Do you want to use my computer?"
CHARLIE: "Are you done with your report?"
TIM: "Yeah. I stayed up all night to finish it."
CHARLIE: "I should've worked on it last night too."
TIM: "Were you busy?"
CHARLIE: "No. I fell asleep. I was so tired."
TIM: "I'm heading home right now. Do you want to go with me?"
CHARLIE: "That would be great! Can I buy you coffee?"
TIM: "Sure. After you finish your report."
CHARLIE: "Good idea!"
