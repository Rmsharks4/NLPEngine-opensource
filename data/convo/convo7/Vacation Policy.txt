Tim:  What is the vacation policy?
Karen:  You earn one week of paid vacation after you've been at the company for one year.
Tim:  I've only been here for nine months, but I would like to take one week off next month.
Karen:  Is it a medical situation?
Tim:  No, my parents live in Italy and it's their 50th wedding anniversary. 
Karen:  You can take one week off with your supervisor's approval, but it will not be a paid week.
