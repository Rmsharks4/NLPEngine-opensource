MIKE: "Hi John. What's wrong?"
JOHN: "Sarah and I had an argument."
MIKE: "Why?"
JOHN: "It's our anniversary today."
MIKE: "Why did you argue on your anniversary?"
JOHN: "She didn't like the gift I got her."
MIKE: "What was it?"
JOHN: "A vacuum cleaner."
MIKE: "A vacuum cleaner? That's not a very romantic gift."
JOHN: "That's what she said. Now she's mad at me."
MIKE: "Well, I can understand her."
JOHN: "It's a practical gift. Something she can use all the time."
MIKE: "What did she get you?"
JOHN: "A watch."
MIKE: "That's a very nice gift."
JOHN: "It's a practical gift. Something I can use all the time."
MIKE: "That's really the same thing, John."
JOHN: "What should I do?"
MIKE: "Return the vacuum and buy her jewelry."
