Tim:  I think I want the blue car instead.
Stephanie:  I thought we agreed to buy the red one.
Tim:  I like the blue one better.  
Stephanie:  You always change your mind.
Tim:  This is an expensive purchase.
Stephanie:  What if you change your mind again after we buy it?
Tim:  I promise I won't change my mind.
Stephanie:  Ok.  Let's buy the blue one.
Tim:  Are you sure?  What is wrong with the red one?
Stephanie:  Nothing.  You said you wanted blue.
