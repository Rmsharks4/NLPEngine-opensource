Erin:  Could you do me a big favor?
Elizabeth:  What is it?
Erin:  My dog sitter is sick.  Could you watch my dog for a few days?
Elizabeth:  How long will you be gone?
Erin:  For three days.
Elizabeth:  How many times a day should I walk him?
Erin:  Twice a day, please.
Elizabeth:  He's going to give me a lot of exercise.  
Erin:  Thank you so much!
Elizabeth:  No problem.  He's a great dog!
