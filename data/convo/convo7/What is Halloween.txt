SUE: "Hello, Anne."
ANNE: "Hi Sue."
SUE: "Can you explain something to me?"
ANNE: "Sure. What is it?"
SUE: "What is Halloween?"
ANNE: "Oh. It's a holiday that we celebrate once a year."
SUE: "Is it the same date every year?"
ANNE: "Yes. It's on October 31."
SUE: "What do people do on that day?"
ANNE: "People dress up in costumes and go to other people's homes to collect candy."
SUE: "Even strangers' homes?"
ANNE: "Yes. They knock on the doors and say 'Trick or Treat.' Then the home owner gives out candy."
SUE: "Do adults do it, too?"
ANNE: "Not many adults. It's usually just children."
SUE: "Isn't that unsafe?"
ANNE: "It can be. But parents go with them."
SUE: "I see. My son wants to do it this year. I didn't know what it was."
ANNE: "You don't do this in your native country?"
SUE: "No. I guess it's a new tradition we have to learn."
ANNE: "It's a lot of fun. Your son will enjoy it."
