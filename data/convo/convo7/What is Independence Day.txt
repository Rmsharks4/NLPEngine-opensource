LEE: "Hey John, what are you doing?"
JOHN: "Oh, hi Lee. I'm setting up tables and chairs for a family BBQ."
LEE: "Is it a special occasion?"
JOHN: "Tomorrow is the fourth of July."
LEE: "I know that tomorrow is July 4, but what is so important about it?"
JOHN: "You don't know. It's our country's Independence Day."
LEE: "What do you mean Independence Day?"
JOHN: "On July 4, 1776, our country's founders declared independence from the rulers of Great Britain."
LEE: "How did America declare independence?"
JOHN: "We went to war against Great Britain called the Revolutionary War and won."
LEE: "Wow! I didn't know that."
JOHN: "Yeah. So, now the United States celebrates this day every year."
LEE: "How do you celebrate?"
JOHN: "We usually have a big BBQ party. Then we light fireworks when it gets dark."
LEE: "Oh, those loud and colorful explosions in the sky?"
JOHN: "Yeah. Would you like to come over and watch them with our family?"
LEE: "Sure. Can I bring my children, too?"
JOHN: "Of course. They will enjoy them. But it is very dangerous, so we have to watch the kids carefully."
