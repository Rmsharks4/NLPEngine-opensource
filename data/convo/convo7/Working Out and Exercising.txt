DAVID: "Hey Paul, have you been working out?"
PAUL: "Hey David. Yeah, I've been going to the gym every day before work."
DAVID: "I need to go too, but I'm so lazy now."
PAUL: "I needed to lose a few pounds. That's what motivated me. Now, I just like going."
DAVID: "I need to lose some weight too. I gained around 20 pounds this year."
PAUL: "You did? Why don't you come with me tomorrow morning?"
DAVID: "What time do you go in the morning?"
PAUL: "5 am. I work out for about an hour."
DAVID: "5 am? That's too early."
PAUL: "You should try it. It feels great to work out early in the morning."
DAVID: "I'm asleep at 5 am."
PAUL: "I'll wake you up tomorrow morning. We can start slow by doing just a little running on the treadmill."
DAVID: "I hate running."
PAUL: "Ok, how about lifting weights?"
DAVID: "I don't have the strength to lift weights."
PAUL: "Ok. How about aerobics?"
DAVID: "That's too much jumping around?"
PAUL: "Yoga?"
DAVID: "Too boring."
PAUL: "You're right, David. You're too lazy to work out."
