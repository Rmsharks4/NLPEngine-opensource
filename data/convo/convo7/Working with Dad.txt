Tina:  Dad, I need help with my project.
Dad:  What do you need help with?
Tina:  Everything.  Nothing is going right.
Dad:  What's wrong?
Tina:  My model keeps falling apart.
Dad:  It looks like your glue is not strong enough.
Tina:  This is the only glue I have.
Dad:  I have stronger glue in the garage.  Let me get it.
Tina:  Thanks, Dad!
Dad:  Be very careful with it.  This glue is very powerful.
