Natalie:  Why are we getting so many wrong phone calls?
Mark:  The newspaper accidentally put the wrong number in someone's ad.  
Natalie:  What kind of ad is it?
Mark:  An ad for a pizza place.
Natalie:  That's why the callers keep asking me if we have any specials this week.
Mark:  Did you tell them we deliver?
Natalie:  That's funny.
