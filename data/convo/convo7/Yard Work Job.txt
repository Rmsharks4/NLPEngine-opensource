TOMMY: "Good afternoon, Mrs. Bailey."
MRS. BAILEY: "Hello Tommy. Why do you look so sad?"
TOMMY: "I need to find a part-time job this summer. I want to buy a new guitar, but I don't have enough money."
MRS. BAILEY: "Well, can you do yard work?"
TOMMY: "Yes! I do yard work for our house all the time. What do you need done?"
MRS. BAILEY: "How about mowing and watering the lawn?"
TOMMY: "I can do both of those things."
MRS. BAILEY: "Bill and I are getting too old to do it. Our son used to take care of our yard, but he moved to another state."
TOMMY: "I see."
MRS. BAILEY: "When can you start?"
TOMMY: "I can start right now!"
MRS. BAILEY: "That would be wonderful. The grass is growing really high."
TOMMY: "Mrs. Bailey."
MRS. BAILEY: "Yes, Tommy."
TOMMY: "May I ask how much the pay is?"
MRS. BAILEY: "Of course. Silly me. How does $30 a week sound?"
TOMMY: "That sounds great! Thank you, Mrs. Bailey."
MRS. BAILEY: "If you do a good job, I may give you more work. I need someone to paint my fence."
TOMMY: "I would love to! I will start mowing now."
MRS. BAILEY: "You're a good boy, Tommy."
