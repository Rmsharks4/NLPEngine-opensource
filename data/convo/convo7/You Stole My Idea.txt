Peter:  You stole my project idea.
Kevin:  I did not.  That was my idea.
Peter:  I came up with that idea during our meeting yesterday.
Kevin:  I don't remember that.
Peter:  You are a liar!  You said it was a great idea.
Kevin:  It's too late.  I already presented the idea to the manager.
Peter:  I am going to tell her that you stole my idea.
Kevin:  You don't have any proof.
Peter:  Yes, I do.  I recorded our meeting.
Kevin:  You are very sneaky.
