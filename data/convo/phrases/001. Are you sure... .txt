I. EXAMPLES:
 Are you sure?
 Are you sure about that?
 Are you sure of what you said?
 Are you sure that he is not coming?
II. DIALOGUES:
A: I’ve had so many problems with my new car. It’s driving me crazy.
B: Are you sure you don’t want to buy a new one?
A: How can I? I already spent a lot of money on this one.
B: I guess you’ll be spending a lot of money on repairs then.
A: I guess so. Unless, you want to buy the car.
B: No, thanks. I don’t think I’d want to buy your car. It has too many problems.
A: I don’t blame you. It’s a piece of junk.
