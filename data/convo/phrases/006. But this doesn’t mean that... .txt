But this doesn’t mean that…
I. EXAMPLES:
 We are your employees,  but  this doesn’t mean that  we must  obey you unconditionally.
 You are much older than I am, but it doesn’t mean that you are right about everything.
 I  support  this measure,  but  it  doesn’t mean that  I  support  you  without reservation.
 I like you, but this doesn’t mean that I’ll marry you.
 II. DIALOGUES:
Wife: Dear, we have been driving around aimlessly for hours. Don’t you think we should ask for directions?
Husband: Look honey, maybe we’ve been driving for a long time,  but  this doesn’t mean that we’re lost.
Wife: Really? Then what have we been doing all this time?
Husband: Well, we’re taking the scenic route.
Wife:  Oh,  I see.  You just  don’t  want  to admit  that  we’re lost.  You know, sometimes you’re too proud.
Husband: OK, we’re lost, but this does not mean that you have to rub it in.
