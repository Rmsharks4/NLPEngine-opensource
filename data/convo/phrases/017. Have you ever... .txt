I. EXAMPLES:
 Have you ever been to New York?
 Have you ever been to Nanjing?
 Have you ever seen Ghost?
 Have you ever wondered if there is life after death?
 Have you ever heard of it?
II. DIALOGUES:
A: I want to quit my job.
B: Why, what’s the matter?
A: Nothing. I just want a change.
B: But you have a great job and you’ve been working there for ten years.
A: I know, but haven’t you ever wanted to do something different?
B: I guess so, but it seems more prudent to just stay where I am and continue
working in my current job.
