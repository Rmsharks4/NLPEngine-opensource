I. EXAMPLES:
 Don’t tell him the bad news until he finishes his exam.
 The secret was not discovered until he was dead.
 I won’t stop shouting until you let me go.
II. DIALOGUES:
A: I heard that Bill got divorced.
B: Yes, he is really sad now.
A:I thought he wanted to get divorced because he didn’t love his wife anymore.
B: Yes, but he didn’t realize how much he needed her until they got divorced.
A: Yeah. Well now it’s too late. She already has another husband.
B: That’s  too bad.  Sometimes people often don’t  appreciate  what  they have until they lose it.
