I. EXAMPLES:
 I can’t wait to see my family.
 I can’t wait to hear from you.
 I can’t wait to buy a computer.
II. DIALOGUES:
Daughter: Only two days until my birthday! I can’t wait!
Mom: Now don’t get too excited, you still have lots of homework to do.
Daughter: I hope a lot of people come to my party.
Mom: Did I tell you that Aunt Jenny will be there?
Daughter: Really! That’s great! Oh, I can’t wait to see her.
Mom:  Me too.  OK, now get  back to your homework.  You still have lots to do before your birthday.
