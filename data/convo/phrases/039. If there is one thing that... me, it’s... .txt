I. EXAMPLES:
 If  there is one thing that  annoys me,  it’s people who don’t keep their promises.
 If there is one thing that disappoints me, it’s his failure to arrange his time responsibly.
 If there is one thing that upsets me, it’s my forgetfulness.
 If there is one thing that surprises me, it’s his winning the competition.
 If there is one thing that interests me, it’s fashion design
II. DIALOGUES:
A: Is that pesky lady coming to the office again?
B: Yeah, I’m afraid so.
A: If there’s one thing that bugs me, it’s her critical attitude.
B: Yeah, well, that’s her personality, I guess.
A: But it’s so annoying. She makes me feel so stupid sometimes.
B: Just don’t pay any attention to her. She won’t stay long.
