I. EXAMPLES:
 I’m afraid you didn’t quite get his meaning.
 A: Could I speak to Elizabeth, please?
B: I’m afraid she is not in at the moment.
 I’m afraid we are going to be late.
 I’m afraid I can’t make it.
II. DIALOGUES:
Policeman: OK, stop right there you thief! Don’t Move!
Bank Manager: Don’t shoot!
Policeman: Put your hands over your head and don’t make any sudden move.
Bank Manager:  Look,  officer, I’m afraid you have the wrong person. I’m the bank manager, not the thief.
Policeman: Are you sure? Oh, I’m sorry. I’m afraid I’ve made a terrible mistake.
Bank Manager: Well, you still have a chance to get your man. I saw somebody carrying a bag full of money running that way.
