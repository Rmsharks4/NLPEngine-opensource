I. EXAMPLES:
 It’s not that I don’t like the car, but I think it is too expensive.
 It’s not that I am unwilling to help you, but I’m tied up with extra work these days.
 It’s not  that  he doesn’t need your help,  but he thinks it  will be an inconvenience to you.
 A mountain is not famous because it is high, but because it has some spirit dwelling in it.
II. DIALOGUES:
Mother: You have to finish your dinner before you leave the table.
Son: But, Mom, I can’t eat anymore. I’m stuffed.
Mother: What’s the matter? It doesn’t taste good?
Son:  It’s not that I don’t like your cooking, but  I ate some cookies before we had dinner.
Mother: And now you don’t have an appetite. You know you’re not supposed to have any snacks before dinner.
Son: Sorry, Mom. I promise I’ll try and finish eating everything.
