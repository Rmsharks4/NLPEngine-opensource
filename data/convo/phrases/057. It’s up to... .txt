I. EXAMPLES:
 A: Do you want to eat a Western or Chinese meal?
B: It’s up to you.
 It’s up to us to help those in need.
 It’s not up to you to tell me how to do my job.
II. DIALOGUES:
Father: I’m looking forward to our son’s graduation this weekend.
Mother: Yes, so am I. But what will he do after graduation? He really needs to go to college.
Father: Well, Dear, we can’t force him to go to college. It’s up to him.
Mother: I know that but he has to learn to be independent. He can’t just keep living at home.
Father: You’re right. I’ll talk to him about getting a job. Maybe he can work at my store.
Mother: That’s  up to you, Dear. You just have to make sure that he does his work and doesn’t loaf around.
