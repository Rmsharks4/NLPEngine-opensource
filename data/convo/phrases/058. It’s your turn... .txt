II. DIALOGUES:

A: No, we made an agreement that we would take turns doing the dishes. Now it’s your turn to do them.
B: OK, I’ll do them. But I’ll warn you I don’t think I can do them as well as you.
A: That’s OK. I’ll give you plenty of chances to practice until you get really good at it.
B: I knew you would say something like that.
