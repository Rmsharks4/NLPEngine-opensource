I. EXAMPLES:
 I’ve had enough of her continual chatter.
 I’ve had enough of your complaining.
 Haven’t you had enough of him? I found him so boring.
 I’ve had enough of the traffic here.
 I’ve had enough of this city.
II. DIALOGUES:
A: New York City is a tough place to live.
B: Yeah, it’s so crowded and the pollution is so bad.
A: You know, I’ve had enough of this city. I’m going to quit my job and move to the country.
B: What will you do for a job?
A: I don’t know. I’ll do anything as long as it means getting out of here.
B: Well,  I don’t think changing your environment  will make things better. You should learn to be content where you are first.
