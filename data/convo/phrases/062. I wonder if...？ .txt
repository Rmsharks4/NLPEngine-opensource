I. EXAMPLES:
 I wonder if it would be convenient to visit you next Monday.
 I wonder if Mr. Wang could arrange a meeting with me.
 I was wondering if the manager would agree with my design.
 I was wondering if you could come to the meeting this afternoon.
II. DIALOGUES:
Salesman:  Excuse me,  Miss,  I wonder if I could have a few minutes of your time?
Woman: Why?
Salesman:  Well,  I’d like to introduce  you to the new super model ZX-2000 vacuum cleaner.
Woman: I’m sorry but I’m in a hurry now. I don’t have time to try it out.
Salesman: That’s no problem. Excuse me for interrupting you. Here, have my card.
Woman:  Thanks.  If  I  get  a chance, I will check out  your vacuum cleaner another time.
