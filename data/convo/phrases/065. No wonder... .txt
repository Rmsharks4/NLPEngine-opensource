 You eat so little. No wonder you are so slim.
 Are you a librarian? No wonder you are so well read.
 There is something wrong with your leg? No wonder you walk so slowly.
II. DIALOGUES:
A: Is there something wrong? You look so sad.
B: My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture.
A: No wonder you look so upset.
B: Yeah. I called the police but they said there was little they could do.
