I. EXAMPLES:
 The more you put your heart into English, the more you’ll be interested in it.
 The more you pay, the more you will gain.
 The sooner, the better.
 The earlier you set about your work, the sooner you will finish it.
II. DIALOGUES:
A: Are you still selling your car?
B: Yeah, but the more I think about it, the more I want to keep it.
A: Why’s that?
B: Because buying a new car would be very expensive and I wouldn’t be able to afford the insurance.
A: But you already put an ad in the paper.
B: I know but if anybody calls, I’ll just tell them it’s not for sale anymore.
