I. EXAMPLES:
 There is nothing as exciting as meeting an old friend unexpectedly.
 For me, there is nothing as enjoyable as reading a novel on the grass.
 There is nothing as pleasant as spending a weekend in the countryside.
 There is nothing as refreshing as having a good rest.
II. DIALOGUES:
A: Do you cook for yourself?
B: Yes, I do, but it’s not the same as what my mother makes.
A: I know what you mean. There’s nothing as good as home cooking.
B: My mom’s given me some recipes, but when I make them they don’t come out the same as when she cooks.
A: Maybe you should just ask her to cook for you.
B: No, I’d rather try and learn myself.
