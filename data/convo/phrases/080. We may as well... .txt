 We may as well buy a Benz since you don’t like Ford.
 We may as well have a try since it’s worth doing.
 We may as well take the risk. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

B: It’s got to be here somewhere.
A: We’ll never find it. We may as well give up.
B: No way. It’s my favorite CD.
A: OK, I’ll help you look for another ten minutes then I’m going home.
B: Don’t worry I know we’ll find it.
