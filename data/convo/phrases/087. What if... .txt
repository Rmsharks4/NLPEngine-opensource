I. EXAMPLES:
 What if it rains when we have no umbrella with us?
 What if they are against us?
 What if we get lost in the jungle?
 What if they don’t approve of our earning some money in our spare time?
II. DIALOGUES:
A: Did you hear the weather forecaster’s  prediction for rain tomorrow?
B:  Yeah,  but  I never believe the weather reports because they are usually wrong.
A: But what if he’s right?
B: I guess we’ll have to change our plans for tomorrow.
A: That means we can’t go to the beach.
B: Only if it rains.
