I. EXAMPLES:
 Where there are difficulties, there are ways to get over them.
 Where there is opposition, there are rebellions.
 Where there is contact, there is friction.
 Where there are women, there are jealousy and suspicion.
 Where there is a will, there is a way.
II. DIALOGUES:
Son:  Dad,  I’ll be having my college interview with  Harvard University  next week.
Father: That’s great son, I’m glad to hear that.
Son:  Yeah, but the problem is the competition to get into that college is very stiff.
Father: Well, are you sure you really want to go there?
Son: Yes, I’ve wanted to go to that college since I was in junior high school.
Father: Don’t worry, Son. If you really want to go there, then I’m sure you will get in. Remember, where there’s a will there’s a way.
