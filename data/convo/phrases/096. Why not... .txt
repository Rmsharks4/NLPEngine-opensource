I. EXAMPLES:
 Why not try to persuade him to give up smoking?
 Why don’t you go ask the teacher?
 Why not buy some ready-made food?
 A: Let’s go to see a film tonight.
B: Sure, why not?
II. DIALOGUES:
Teacher:  I’d like you to introduce the guest speaker at  the student assembly today.
Student: Why me? I can’t do that.
Teacher: Why not? You’re a good student and I think you will do a great job.
Student:  But  I’ve never spoken in front of so many people before.  I wouldn’t know what to say.
Teacher: Don’t worry. I’ll help you prepare the speech. Why not give it a try?
Student: OK, I guess I have nothing to lose.
