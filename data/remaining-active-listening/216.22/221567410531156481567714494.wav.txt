  {
    "transcript": " just as a future reference as well whenever you want to use this card had restaurant %HESITATION there is a twenty person extra hold which is required in order to process the transactions like you were trying to use it for forty six forty eight the twenty personal forty six forty eight is nine dollars and twenty nine cents so if you had both of these transactions amount it is going over fifty dollars and that is why it got declined this extra hole is not a charge you normally get it back to your card after the transaction is settled by the merchant like within twenty four to forty eight hours okay but in order to initiate the transaction at restaurants like hotels and motels the twenty person extra hold should be available in the car so that was not available and that is why it got declined so my suggestion to you is whenever you want to use a restaurant use it for forty dollars so that means the eight dollars will be available in it and then you can go over the actual holding later on you get your eight dollars back okay this was the reason for the decline transaction address Rhonda K. other transaction %HESITATION which you were trying to make I can see which is declined that was the cracker barrel what is it what is cracker barrel",

    "transcript": " in gas station in gas station %HESITATION %HESITATION you have to use it inside over the counter don't use it are the pump okay you have to go inside over the counter use it because of the gas station next door also applies so you can avoid that by using it inside and specifically at the restaurants twenty portion of the %HESITATION reason amount is the extra or like if you want to use it for forty dollars then eight dollars which is the twenty personal forty that is actually required to process the transactions %HESITATION you know add restaurants so if you want to use a restaurant right now use it for forty dollars so you will be able to go over %HESITATION the twenty percent extra Horton later on which you will get back okay and %HESITATION you can try a game I can see that the transaction the restaurant was declined because of the extra hold end %HESITATION the one you were trying to use the cracker there was something wrong from the merch inside %HESITATION the merging system was not accepting the card that is right guard declined otherwise the cards okay there's nothing wrong with the card okay yes so before you go I just want to ask you would you like me to to register the card %HESITATION you want to use it online or you just want to use it in stores",
