# A C unit (act) is the basic unit for speech act / intent annotation.
# Syntactically, it is an independent clausal or a non clausal unit.
# C units are the basic units (or ‘envelopes’) for conveying intents
# (also called ‘moves’ or ‘dialogue acts’),
# which can be regarded as the minimal communicative actions performed in a dialogue.
