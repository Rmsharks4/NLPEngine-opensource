# an imperative clause, with a verb in its base (uninflected),
# form which normally occurs in initial position:
# Look where you’re going. Come on.
# A clause beginning Let’s or Let me is classed as an imp,
# although in its function it can imply action on the part of the speaker rather than of the addressee.
# but its not always true: example - what did you do? Phone the police.
# Here he says he's done something, its not imperative. (Answer to Question)
