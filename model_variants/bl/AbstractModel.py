# Lets note down all the models i have to work on!

#1. Active Listening
#2. Enthusiastic Tone
#3. Confidence/Ownership
#4. Clear Understanding
#5. Customer Name Use
#6. No Dead Air
#7. Customer Verification
#8. Appropriate Probing
#9. Abusive Words (Fatal Criteria)

# Lets group these into similar categories:

# Active Listening, Confidence/Ownership, Clear Understanding, Appropriate Probing
# Customer Name Use, No Dead Air, Customer Verification, Abusive Words (Fatal Criteria)
# Enthusiastic Tone

# Okay so lets define these groups now:

# The first one kinda looks at the structure of sentences
# The second kinda looks for specific words
# The third one is working on speaking rate and difficulty index only.

# Now lets start looking for models that can help each group make accurate predictions.
